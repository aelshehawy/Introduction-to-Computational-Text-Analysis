It took a month and a half for Romanov to modify the 25-year-old car into what he calls a ‘Т-21099 tank\\' that is able to overcome snow banks.

He says that the vehicle is useful in a countryside landscape where nobody clears the snow. \"It is really interesting. It can be useful, for example, when you come to the countryside, no one will clear the snow here and it is too far to go with a shovel,” he told Ruptly. “I bolted the shovel to it and cleaned the snow - now it is clean, as you can see.

            "['22 Jul, 2016 13:33 ', 'Welcome to the circus of US political conventions', 'op-edge', 'The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma-challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard-waving, holler-whooping people bused in from every town in the country. Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process. Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years. It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next. A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more. For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame. This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy-eyed patriot boasts. In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous. In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought. At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was “Lock her up! Lock her up!” with all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman’s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house. Trump promises to “Make America Great Again,” a sufficiently open-ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean. Given the billionaire’s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president. But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and is less than enthusiastic about NATO. This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm. Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin. She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, the gloating over the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America’s way be described as progressive. Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have some\\xa0interesting friends and supporters - Wall Street and George Soros prime among them – who aren’t exactly struggling to get by. Then, too, the sympathy she’s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill’s notorious crime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities. This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end. It is a two-term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question. How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years? LIVE on #Periscope: Watch Donald Trump speak at #RNCinCLEhttps://t.co/4u91jEcVo7 The question answers itself, as it does when applied to every US president and administration since the end of the Second World War, condemning each and every one with crimes against humanity committed on a mammoth scale. It is why the gulf between the Hollywood circus that is the Republican and Democrat National Conventions – with their nauseating celebration of US exceptionalism – and the reality for the millions who have suffered and will continue to suffer regardless of who enters the White House this year exposes US democracy as a sham. It is the best democracy that money can buy. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. ']\n",

            "['3 Aug, 2016 19:27 ', \"'PM of conflict': Netanyahu to blame for pushing Palestinians out of jobs, says SodaStream CEO\", 'news', \"Speaking during an exclusive interview with the Times of Israel, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum accused Netanyahu of being personally involved in a bureaucratic process which forced the company to fire its Palestinian employees. According to Birnbaum, it all began when SodaStream decided it needed more space, and opted to close its West Bank factory. The move did, however, follow a boycott campaign\\xa0against the company, in which critics accused it of making money on land “stolen” by Israel.  Though Birnbaum insists the move was made voluntarily, he says the Israeli government is arguing that SodaStream was forced to move due to the pressure from the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as fire the 500 Palestinians working there. But the company insists that despite claims from the Netanyahu government, it wanted to retain 350 of its 500 Palestinian employees to work at its new plant in the Negev. However, according to Birnbaum keeping such a high number of employees was impossible because the company was initially only granted permits for 120 of the Palestinian workers – a number which new conditions later reduced to 74. Since February, those remaining 74 employees have been barred from Israel, their permits retroactively canceled. “Apparently our 74 Palestinians represent a threat to [Netanyahu's] agenda,” Birnbaum said. The CEO says Netanyahu – who he refers to as the “prime minister of conflict” – is responsible for the outcome, adding that his office “intervened to stop the employment of our Palestinians so that Bibi [Netanyahu] can then point a finger at the BDS.” Birnbaum did not mince his words when speaking about the prime minister, accusing him of “systematically spreading hate within Israel between Jews and Arabs and between Orthodox and secular...” “It pains me to say that I believe this administration is nurturing the conflict in all its evil manifestations. They nurture the hate and the boycott and they nurture separatism,” he said. Unsurprisingly, the story coming from Netanyahu's office is starkly different. An official who asked to remain anonymous told the Times of Israel that Birnbaum had relocated his factory because of pressure from the BDS movement. He then noted that once SodaStream was out of the West Bank and inside Israel, it was required to comply with Israeli labor laws – meaning priority had to be given to Israeli workers. “SodaStream went from no quotas at Mishor Adumim, moved inside the Green Line, and was required to follow Israeli labor laws,” the official said. “So it had to lose its Palestinian workers.” The official went on to accuse Birnbaum of being ungrateful towards Netanyahu, as the PM had assisted Birnbaum with a grace period during the transition, arranging for two extensions for Palestinian workers. “The prime minister wanted to help make the transition more smooth. The lack of gratitude is appalling,” the official said. “The PM could have said, ‘We’re not helping him at all.’ Maybe we shouldn’t have helped him. To say it’s personal animus is despicable.” Meanwhile, Birnbaum says that Netanyahu would benefit from taking a leaf out of SodaStream's book, choosing to boost the number of Palestinians working in Israel rather than depriving them of opportunities. He stated that the biggest terrorist threat from Palestinians stems from those working in Israel without permission, stressing that such permits could “buy security.” \"]\n",
            "['31 Aug, 2016 16:03 ', 'Blocking online porn could be against EU law', 'uk', ' Current EU rules allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content for three reasons: to comply with a member state’s laws, to manage levels of traffic across a network, or for security. The net neutrality rules are intended to prevent broadband operators from favoring specific sources of content such as commercial partners. Blocking porn falls into a gray area, as there is no clear legal framework in UK legislation. However, a revision to the guidelines issued by EU body Berec says blocked content, whether it is porn or ads, should be implemented by a customer on their device, rather than by the network. Frode Sorensen, co-chair of the Berec working group on net neutrality, refused to comment to the Guardian on specific cases or countries, but said the updated guidance made it clear there was no legal basis for using customer choice to justify blocking any content. ISPs Sky, BT and TalkTalk, and mobile operator O2 block access to adult sites following pressure from the government. Mobile operator Three recently ran an ad-blocking trial that required users to opt in. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson told the newspaper the rules still allowed for internet filters. “Family-friendly filters are permitted under the EU net neutrality regulation. The regulations give end-users the right to access information and content of their choice, and enabling/disabling filters exercises this choice.” A spokesperson for BT told the newspaper: “BT offers filtering at both network and device level dependent on the customer’s preferences. “The Berec guidelines are not binding and it’s for Ofcom to consider in its application and enforcement of EU regulations.” It a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom will monitor compliance with the new rules, and look into any complaints received. We will consider any potential breaches as they arise in accordance with our interpretation of the regulation, and drawing upon the Berec guidelines to inform our approach.” ']\n",

And we are very glad that The Wall Street Journal does this now and that we are joined now by the international press, because in Belgium the battle is very severe. The media and the regime are doing this because of what we call the Islamosocialism. All governments in Belgium are either left-wing or central-left wing, or at least are doing what they are doing now and what has been discovered now.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system. What should be done to prevent them from receiving welfare payments?\\xa0 GA: First of all, we have to choose other leaders, elect other leaders; leaders that have steel teeth, and can bite and can fight against Islamization of our society, and for instance blocking the social security. It is an enormous tragedy that we are in this paradox that the Belgium taxpayers paid for this Islamic attacks. We need other leaders, we need other leadership, we need to rethink our western democracies.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Do you think there could be more incidents like this?\\xa0 GA: Well, we have the tragedy of the asylum seekers, the millions that come now and that are all on our social security, because only a tiny minority gets work and helps our economy, or deals with our economy. So most of them end up in our social security system, which is, by the way, the reason why they come to Europe. They don’t stop where it is safe, or where there are no bullets shot anymore. They stop where there is social security. That is why they come to Germany, to Belgium, to Holland, and not to the other countries that they travel leaving Syria. This is a serious mistake to think that we have to change the people of Europe, that we have to exchange them with a new Islamic and mostly Muslim people. This is a failure, a mistake, politically, culturally, in every sense of the word.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Many of the attacks were carried out not by refugees, but by the people who were born or raised in the EU. How do you propose to deal with those kind of people?\\xa0 GA: These people, the people that are here, and are peaceful, and are not radicalizing, or are not promoting Muslim society on Western Europe soil, these people should get the message from our politicians, from our political regimes that they should adapt to our culture of our society. And for the rest we should close the borders that the EU opened widely. We must not let [Angela] Merkel decide our future. People and countries like ours should decide upon that themselves. The Merkel, the [Jean-Claude] Juncker, and the EU way of dealing with these problems is not the way we want it. The people should stand up and vote for leaders in their countries that promise to stop all these.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were getting welfare benefits?\\xa0 Jean Bricmont: I think that is a very bad argument. Of course, if the people knew that they were plotting terrorist attack then it was not a matter of cutting welfare, but putting them away in jail, or under surveillance, or something. The argument against welfare, which is used here, is very bad. It suggests that we should cut welfare, but to whom? To all the Muslim, to all the suspects, to everybody? The present government is already cutting welfare, and welfare has been cut and cut over the years. I think if anything it will probably increase the danger, because it would put more people in a precarious situation, which may lead them to violent action. I don’t think welfare is the problem at all. In fact fiscal fraud is much, much bigger than the welfare spending. So if welfare could prevent the terrorist attack it would be a very small amount of money. You might find it shocking that people on welfare kill other people, but what is shocking is not that they get welfare, but that they kill other people. If they had a job and were not receiving welfare, I would find it just as terrible and shocking.\\xa0\\xa0 It seems to me that The Wall Street Journal, in line with its neoliberal agenda, is trying to use this argument against welfare, which I think is a very bad argument. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is psychologically shocking, but stop and think about it. Stop welfare to whom?\\xa0 If we know that they are terrorists than it is not a matter of welfare, it is a matter of putting them under police control – so a very different business.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system.\\xa0 You would prefer then to ignore that fact, wouldn’t you?\\xa0 JB: Well, the question is: what did the police know? Obviously we should fight the Islamic State. I myself would be in favor of joining Russia in Syria and fighting them, other than doing what\\xa0 we do, which is inefficient bombing. That is a problem on the ground, it is not a problem of Belgian citizens, or even migrants in European countries…\\xa0 RT: How do you assess the level of security in the EU right now in the wake of a spate of horrific attacks, many of which were carried out by refugees?\\xa0 JB: It is pretty bad, but the point is that they are not refugees. Many of these people were citizens of the European countries. They grew up here. I don’t know every individual case, but many of the terrorists grew up here. They got very upset with… the trouble we created in the Middle East and the instability we created there.

            "['10 Nov, 2016 00:13 ', 'Trump wins Electoral College thanks to older whites, loses popular vote', 'usa', 'Although the votes are still being counted in some states, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote with nearly 59.8 million votes, compared to Trump’s almost 59.6 million votes \\xa0– a lead of about 0.2 percentage points or more than 200,000 votes. Winning the popular vote is a bitter consolation prize for Clinton, as overall victory is based on the 538 members of the Electoral College, each of whom represent a state or the District of Columbia based on population. The number of electoral voters a state gets is equal to its representation in Congress, with a minimum of three (Delaware, DC, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) and a maximum of 55 (California). The winning candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. With Michigan (16) and New Hampshire (4) still outstanding, Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton only 218. Trump is set to become the second president in 16 years to win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote; George W. Bush was the first in the controversial 2000 election. However, it happened twice in 12 years in the 1800s: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Hayes suffered the biggest loss in the popular vote, losing by 3 percentage points to Southern Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Trump comes in second at 1.2 points. Both Bush and Harrison lost by less than a point to Vice President Al Gore and incumbent President Grover Cleveland respectively, according to Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidents. There is one other time that a president entered the White House without winning the popular vote, but that was in 1824, due to a four-way race that did not produce a winner in the Electoral College, forcing the House of Representatives to decide, in accordance with the 12th Amendment. The House elected John Quincy Adams as president. At that point in time, candidates did not run as a combined presidential and vice presidential ticket, and John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency outright. The situation that Trump finds himself in is thus relatively rare, but shifting demographics in the country mean that it could happen more often in the future, according to Vox. The US is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2055, there will not be a single racial or ethnic majority, the Pew Research Center found ahead of the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meeting. Most of those population gains by minorities are occurring in solidly Democratic and solidly Republican states, which means that they did nothing to shift the electoral map. While Trump made headway into all racial and ethnic groups compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, it was still whites who handed him his victory, with 58 percent voting for him, compared to 37 percent for Clinton. Whites made up 70 percent of voters on Tuesday. Trump gained 7 percentage points among black voters, 8 points among Hispanic and Latinos, 11 percent among Asians and 1 percent among other ethnic groups, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polling. However, that doesn’t mean he did well among those groups. The vast majority of black voters (88 percent) chose Clinton, as did 65 percent each of Hispanic/Latino and Asian voters, while 56 percent of people belonging to other ethnic groups voted for Clinton. Millennials ‒ in this case defined as those born after 1980 ‒ have likely replaced the baby boomers as the largest generation. Trump again made headway with this group, gaining 5 points over Romney, but lost the group overall. More than half (55 percent) voted for Clinton, while only 37 percent opted for Trump. It was voters age 45 and older ‒ the baby boomers and Generation X ‒ who gave him the victory, with 53 percent voting for Trump. So basically, Trump won because of older white people, according to @nytimes & @cnn analyses of exit polling pic.twitter.com/rkfXLWixau If millennials had been the only voters, it would have been a landslide victory for Clinton in the Electoral College. Instead, however, they were in the minority, making up only 44 percent of voters on Tuesday. This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision. pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869 There is one place that the popular vote does matter, however: third parties. If a third-party candidate receives 5 percent of the vote, then their party is eligible to receive federal grants from the Federal Election Commission in the 2020 general election. Unfortunately for Libertarian Gary Johnson (less than 4.1 million), Green Jill Stein (just over 1.2 million) and independent Evan McMullin (about 423,000), none of them reached the necessary milestone. If all their votes were to be combined, they would come to just under 5.7 million, or about half a million votes short. ']\n",

In order to achieve these goals, Russia plans to use a new type of a manned spacecraft called the Federatsiya (Federation). Russian space rocket corporation Energia will start construction of the spacecraft and software development this summer, the company’s chief designer told journalists. The Federatsiya will be a new generation vessel to replace the currently used Soyuz spaceships. It is designed for transferring people and delivering cargo to the moon and the International Space Station (ISS). Its crew will be four to six cosmonauts. The spaceship is expected to be able to operate autonomously for up to 30 days. It can be deployed to the ISS for up to one year. The testing of the spacecraft is expected to start in 2021, with an unmanned flight launched from Russia’s new Vostochny spaceport in the Far Eastern Amur region. The first test will be followed by two more launches in 2023, including one manned flight. The Angara A5B heavy carrier rocket will be used for the launches, TASS reports. Earlier, it was reported that Federatsiya test flights will include four launches, two of which will be manned and one will involve a flyover of the moon. Energia Corporation has already unveiled another project designed for a potential lunar trip. The company presented draft plans for a new reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the ISS and the moon called the Ryvok (Charge of Breakthrough) at the Human Space Exploration international conference in Korolev, near Moscow, on May 26. The Ryvok spacecraft will be permanently based on the ISS – or its descendant – and will serve as the mid-way shuttle for delivering cargo and crews to the moon, the representatives of the company said at the conference, adding that Ryvok will be much more cost efficient compared to the Federatsiya spacecraft. The Energia Corporation and NASA are also discussing a project to create a joint space station orbiting the moon, which could be put into operation by the end of the next decade, Energia's representative Yuri Makushenko told journalists at the conference. The new space station will have accommodation and energy modules as well as nodes and spaceships, he added. The new station is expected to become a transport hub for maintenance, communications and navigation of the lunar missions and for un-manned missions to Mars and the asteroid belt between the Red Planet and Jupiter. \"]\n",
            "['19 Sep, 2016 13:39 ', 'West has ‘no lesson to give to Russia about democracy’ – former MEP', 'op-edge', \"Sunday’s general election Russia saw people vote for members of the lower house, the State Duma and several regional heads. With almost all the votes counted, the ruling United Russia party is likely to secure the majority of seats in the Duma. It's followed by the Russian Communist party (KPRF) and the Liberal Democrats (LDPR), who are neck and neck. Fair Russia has also made it to the lower house with about 6 percent of the votes. The result of the vote didn’t come as any surprise. Various polls and analysts predicted United Russia was going to remain the majority party. However, Western media criticized the election dubbing it “a show” and “a farce” even before it started. Yvan Blot, former member of the French and European Parliaments, says this election result reminded him of the French presidential elections when Charles de Gaulle “had 50 percent of the votes.” “It is the same now in Russia with United Russia, Putin’s party. What strikes me is that all political parties in the majority and in the opposition are patriotic. It is not the case in France, I must admit,” he told RT. Former French MP Blot, commenting on the matter said Western countries should mind their own election process. State Duma elections start in Russia https://t.co/bQvOEODkBO For instance, in France, the system “is less democratic than the Russian one,” he said. He referred to the way Russian lawmakers are elected to the Duma: half of the MPs are elected from single-mandate districts (one candidate per district), the other half - from party candidate lists on a proportional basis. “In France we have a more simple system: every candidate comes from a constituency. But constituencies were designed by the most powerful party some years ago. With the result of 1/3 of the votes the National Front has only two members of Parliament. Is that democratic? It is not democratic at all. It is the same for the extreme left. [It] has very few members of Parliament, but they have voices,” he said. “Besides, candidates in France are selected in general by little committees of oligarchs within political parties. We have no primaries, except now in the Republican Party Presidential election. But in general it is not a tradition to have primaries,” Blot said. Primaries had not been a common thing for Russia either until this year, when ahead of the September 18 parliamentary vote, United Russia held nationwide primaries. The third “big problem” in France, according to Blot, is that opinions of political leaders differ from those of voters. “For that reason people are very deceived by all political parties. In France the rate of trust for a political party is only 18 per cent of the people. I think we have no lesson to give to Russia about democracy. Russia is not perfect – perfection doesn’t exist in the world. But I think the system has much improved since some years and now it is more democratic than in France,” the former MP said. Adam Garrie, author at The Duran says the Western media painted the Russian vote “as a show” because they “don’t want to admit that the democracy in Russia is indeed one of the most vibrant and, more importantly, diverse in the free world”. “When you just listen to some of the many debates in the Duma, you’ve got a broader range of opinions than you’ve got in the British Parliament, in the US Congress, or most places in Europe,” he told RT. In recent years, the Russian government has introduced a number of changes to make elections more representative. For instance, the threshold for parties to get into parliament was lowered to 5 percent and a prominent human rights activist, Ella Pamfilova was appointed to head the Central Election Commission. Garrie explains Western media have an agenda, “and the agenda doesn’t rely on the facts”. “The fact of the matter is that the Russian government has gone out of its way to make this one of the most widespread free and fair elections possible from opening polling stations in some of the most remotest parts of the world – to videotaping all the polling stations to catch any possible irregularities when and as they happen. This factual truth isn’t something that seems to match the Western narrative – that says the Russian electoral system is somehow backwards or undemocratic. Perhaps they are ashamed that the Russian system is slightly more democratic and certainly more ideologically and personally diverse than a lot of place in the so-called West,” he said.\\xa0 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"]\n",

The channel will be excluded from free transmission, but will still remain in paid TV packages. The media governing body expressed its “gratitude” for a fruitful cooperation and the contribution of RT Spanish to the national satellite and digital broadcasts in a letter signed by RTA’s Maria Eugenia Martinez, who emphasized that current notification of suspension “does not prevent the conclusion of other future partnerships.” On June 7, a similar letter was sent to the pan-Latin American terrestrial and satellite television network TeleSUR TV, notifying that its broadcasting in Argentina would be suspended within 15 days. TeleSUR President Patricia Villegas denounced the move as “censorship” on the part of the right-wing Argentine president Mauricio Macri and his government. Both letters cited the “need to renew the program listings” of Argentina’s Experimental System of Digital Terrestrial Television and Satellite Television Systems as the reason for suspensions. Censura @mauriciomacri a @teleSURtv#NoNosCallarán#TeleSURConArgentinapic.twitter.com/Mxb3l9UfE9 “The official explanation has been that they need those channels presently occupied by the RT Spanish signal, and also the TeleSur Venezuela signal. The government is saying, officially, that they need those two frequency slots to transmit provincial channels, channels from Argentinian provinces, for example Tierra del Fuego which is way down in the South,” said international political analyst and RT contributor Adrian Salbuchi. “But that is hardly a credible explanation of any sort whatsoever.” READ MORE: RT and Venezuela TeleSUR journalists unite to provide fresh perspective on news “RT and also TeleSUR… definitely [have] a very alternative view on international politics, finance, economic treaties, for example like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so forth… regrettably, what we are seeing at least in Argentina is a case of censorship where the government does not want alternative viewpoint… to be heard by the Argentinian population,” Salbuchi added. OP-EGDE: ‘RT broadcast halt in Argentina is all-out psychological onslaught on Latin America’ “I think that part of this is an effort to deny the citizens of Argentina the opportunity to hear a plurality of voices about what is taking place in other countries in the region,” believes RT Spanish “Behind the News” host and attorney Eva Golinger. “This is a government that has just completed six months in office. It’s a really narrow timeframe, and yet they’ve already taken harsh measures… TeleSUR may have had a more critical voice towards the government, but this is a government that ran on a platform saying they were promoting wider democracy and more freedoms in Argentina. And now we are seeing that what they are actually doing is the opposite.” Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Upper House committee for foreign affairs, said that the main reason for RT’s suspension “is the shift in the power in Argentina” after pro-American Mauricio Macri became president in late 2015. According to the official, the move is one of the first signs of Argentina’s rapprochement with the US. “The US always and everywhere are trying to consistently monopolize the information realm and remove all other alternative sources of information. We know how concerned the US authorities are by the popularity of RT,” Kosachev stressed. The decision to launch RT’s Spanish-language channel as part of the Latin American country’s national television broadcast in 2014 was applauded by the presidents of Russia and Argentina. “Harsh information wars and the attempts of some countries to monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests have become a sign of modern times,”\\xa0President Vladimir Putin said at the time, stressing that “in these circumstances alternative sources of information are particularly in demand.

CSKA Moscow and Finland midfielder Roman Eremenko gets two-year ban from UEFA after testing positive for cocaine. “The Finnish player has been suspended for two years from all competitions, following the positive result of a doping control test in competition undergone by the player after the UEFA Champions League group stage match between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and PFC CSKA Moskva played on 14 September 2016 in Germany,” the press release reads. After giving a positive sample for cocaine, but before being suspended, Eremenko played against Spurs in CL and in 3 Russian league games. “The analysis of the A sample revealed the presence of cocaine and its metabolites - a stimulant that is classified under the category of prohibited substances in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 2016 Prohibited List under class S6 - being prohibited in-competition. “The player was found guilty of being in breach of the UEFA Anti-Doping Regulations, Edition 2016. As a result, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body decided to impose a two-year ban on Roman Eremenko, starting from 6 October 2016 date of the provisional suspension.

The majority of the thousands of extra staff hired as contractors are thought to come from the private sector, according to the newspaper. “They are all security-vetted and sworn to secrecy.” David Davis, a Conservative Party MP, told the Times that secrecy surrounding GCHQ’s numerical strength was “a bad opening chapter to this new era of transparency.” A spokesperson for GCHQ declined to give exact numbers of those employed in the agency and its partners. \"The total number of people working for or with GCHQ constantly fluctuates due to the complex challenges we face and the threats we aim to counter,\" the spokesperson told IBTimes UK, adding: \"In a complex organization like GCHQ, as you would expect, our core mission is supported by a range of partners including industry and the military.” GCHQ employed 5,683 full-time staff in August 2014, according\\xa0to official figures from the UK parliament\\'s Intelligence and Security Committee. MI5 had 3,926 and MI6 2,430 employees.\\xa0 “We should be asking why are these numbers so secret? And who is paying for all these people? Is Britain paying or is GCHQ doing things for other people who are paying?” Mr Davis told the Times. In November, UK Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hire over 1,900 new spies, citing growing security concerns. \"We need to do more to ensure our agencies have the resources and the information they need to prevent and disrupt plots against this country at every stage.

This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counter-terrorism experts in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,\" Cameron said. \"We will also more than double our spending on aviation security around the world with more experts overseas working side by side with host nations in the most vulnerable locations. We also need to do more to make sure the powers we give our security services keep pace with changes in technology,\" he added. Last month, the UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (a judicial body independent of the British government, which hears complaints about surveillance by public bodies) was told that GCHQ is “persistent” in its hacking of phones and computers across the globe. GCHQ activities include using the microphones and cameras built into devices to spy on people, locate their position and access documents and pictures, lawyers representing civil liberties group Privacy International told the tribunal. The intelligence agency cited the heightened threat of terrorism to justify its actions, saying: “Over the last year the threat to the UK from international terrorism has continued to increase,” James Eadie, representing GCHQ, said in his written arguments to the tribunal. The case was brought in light of revelations by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who exposed the extent of GCHQ surveillance.  ']\n",

The actions \"could amount to war crimes,\" he warned. Government-held West Aleppo has been under constant fire from the rebel-controlled East for several weeks now with many civilians, including children, falling victim to the attacks. RT: Do you think there will be, at some point, an official investigation into human rights violations committed by rebel groups as they continue with their attacks on western Aleppo? Jim Jatras: Well, there certainly should be and the question whether they will be is very difficult to answer because, remember, these are groups supported by the US and other Western countries and by our allies in the region - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so forth. Despite the fact that these are terrorist groups, that they are Al-Qaeda and their various allies, and they are very reluctant to put a spotlight on the kind of people that we’re supporting in this region. Let’s remember, a couple of months ago the Al-Zinki group was alleged of using chlorine gas. And the State Department spokesman was asked, ‘if we were shown [that] they used chlorine gas, would we drop our support for them?’ And he refused to answer. So I’m afraid we’re going to see a roadblock put in by Western governments to avoid that kind of investigation. RT: If they continue to commit what may amount to war crimes, could the rebels lose Western support? In terms of public opinion, is there any chance we\\'ll start seeing a shift in attitude toward armed opposition groups in Syria? JJ: It is certainly out of the bag for people who watch RT and who tune into alternative media. But as far as the American mainstream media goes, it is not out of the bag at all. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups. I would be very interested to see in the very next couple of days, will the American and other Western European mainstream media report this and pin the blame where it belongs - on these terrorists and on the governments that are supporting them. RT: Are the attacks and potential war crimes receiving sufficient coverage to sway public opinion? JJ: Absolutely not. These attacks are not new, these attacks against West Aleppo have been going on continuously and they receive zero reporting in the Western media. I monitor the American media pretty closely, and look at the double standards on how they report on say the offensive against Mosul versus the offensive against East Aleppo. They are night and day difference and I have not heard any reports of terrorist attacks on West Aleppo in the American media. RT: In their latest assault, it appears the rebels used chlorine gas. Where are they likely to have acquired such weapons or the materials required for their assembly? JJ: We’ve had a couple of instances with sarin, for example. There have been allegations in the past that this has been done inside Turkey. I am not in a position to verify that, but given that that’s the main route of the supply for the terrorists, that would be a reasonable speculation to start with. Moderate radical groups are like a Trojan Horse that Western countries and the Gulf States put inside Syria, says Dr. Said Sadiq, professor of political sociology at the American University of Cairo. RT: Staffan de Mistura has condemned the rebel’s actions in Aleppo. Will Western politicians and media now shift their attention to the atrocities the rebels are committing? Dr. Said Sadiq: Despite the fact that not Mistura alone but also the UN Secretary General also condemned what is happening, but all Western media attention is going now to the battle of Mosul in Iraq and what is happening in Aleppo is being sidestepped and played down in international media… RT: Today there was a chemical gas attack in western Aleppo. Will the West reassess its support for these so called moderate groups if it is confirmed the rebels conducted it? SS: We have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf States invested in those moderate radical groups and so they cannot abandon them. They are like the Trojan Horse that they had put inside the Syrian domestic situation. They cannot pull out now and say: “Okay, we discovered that we were wrong, let’s get out and leave them.” They have invested in them and they will still use them in bargaining in the future of Syria. So, if there are any future negotiations on the fate of Syria, those people, these cards of radicals and moderates will be used on the negotiating table. I don’t think that they will get rid of them soon. Secondly, how did they get all those chemical weapons? The Gulf States provide weapons but they don’t have chemicals. So, most likely the chemical weapons had come from a NATO country. Because these are the only countries that have such kind of weapons. How did these chemical weapons come to the Syrian rebels? You will have the usual suspect –Turkey. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups.\\xa0 RT: The UK plans to launch a new program to train rebels and supply them with weapons. Last year a similar program was a complete failure and ended up with the rebels fighting alongside ISIS and Al-Nusra. Will the same happen again? SS: Six years of wasted resources and money to destroy Syria and they failed. The objective that was declared: “We will topple the Assad regime.” Six years and nothing happened. Do you think that one more year or more investment will tip the iceberg and change what we have seen? I doubt it. I think it was wasted money and they had one strategic aim: They don’t want the gas coming from Qatar to cross Syria to Europe and also to destroy the Syrian society, not the Syrian regime, Syrian society, the Syrian army, Syrian territorial integrity.

The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. “The ‘Russian card’ has been used to demonize one particular candidate – to tie him with Russia, which is not particularly popular in the US at the moment and therefore to diminish his prospects,” former British diplomat Alastair Crooke told RT. He also warned that the deliberate “demonization of Russia in every aspect” used as a political tool during the US presidential campaign will have “a substantive long-term effect on the relations, whoever will be president.” “It will make it very, very difficult for [the future US president] to start a new relationship with the Russian president afterwards,” Crooke stressed. His words were partly echoed by writer John Wight, who told RT that accusing Russia of meddling with the US election process on behalf of Donald Trump is “reckless and very dangerous because whoever will be the next president, he or she is going to deal with Russia.” At the same time, Wight stressed, “it is in the interest of the US people as well as of the people of the whole world that the US reset relations with Russia.” Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. “He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race.

She said she had been taking meldonium for more than a decade because of health problems and was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in March after announcing she had failed a test at the Australian Open in Melbourne. However, the Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev said Sharapova’s ban could be addressed in a meeting with ITF head David Haggerty later this month. “The situation with Sharapova could be resolved after April 21 when we meet with the head of the international federation. After that all should be become clear. It is too early to talk about Sharapova competing at the Olympic Games,” TASS quoted Tarpishchev as saying, as cited by Reuters. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was happy that WADA had been flexible regarding meldonium in a statement on its website, as cited by TASS.\\xa0 “The Russian Sports Ministry supports and welcomes the decision made by WADA because it has showed a willingness to understand the situation, rather than stick to the rulebook. They were ready to study how long it would take for meldonium to be eliminated from the body of an athlete. WADA has sent recommendations to all the anti-doping organizations, which will allow them to make fair decisions based on the actual guilt of an athlete. In doing so, WADA has demonstrated impartiality and being objective in the fight against doping.”\\xa0 The five-time speed skating world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov and the 2014 Olympic short track gold medalist Semen Elistratov are two athletes who are set to benefit from WADA’s ruling, and the president of the Russian Speed Skating Union Aleksey Kravtsov told R-Sport that the pair should be allowed to compete again.\\xa0 “These sportsmen should be allowed to fall under the amnesty due to the amount found in their doping tests. They were not guilty, as we had been saying earlier. This is of course good news, but there is still a bit of a cloud hanging over all of this,” he said. ']\n",

There will be a first time face-off as well, with undecided voters challenging the candidates on the issues. Again organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, this event will differ in several ways from the first debate a worldwide audience witnessed less than two weeks ago. Not only will the audience, chosen by the Gallup Organization, be asking half of all the questions, but there will be two moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News, instead of just one to handle the remainder.

And no, the third-party presidential candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein, did not improve their numbers to the level the debate commission requires for a spot in the debate.

This unpredictable election cycle continues to heat up, and the rules of the campaign trail are still being rewritten.

That red state, however, seems to be veering toward battleground status, as RT\\'s Ed Schultz hosted a political town hall in Fargo on Thursday night.

Her campaign and affiliated accounts have $150 million on hand as of early October, in addition to $80 million already set aside for TV ads as well as more money for direct voter outreach. The report calculates the Clinton camp can afford to spend almost $5 million every single day ahead of November 8, and that does not count the Democratic National Committee coffers of around $11.5 million, from September reports, or the Priorities USA Action Super PAC, which began September with $40 million. The real estate tycoon, however, reported just $38 million at the start of September, compared to the Republican National Committee with $40.5 million, Politico reported.

The attack follows the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old black man, Alton Sterling, by two white police officers in Baton Rouge earlier in July. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake responded to a call that a man was allegedly using a gun to threaten another man outside a convenience store. Following the arrival of the police, Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point-blank range. The two officers, who are both currently suspended, claimed Sterling reached for a gun before being shot at by law enforcers. In a video recording of the incident, one of the officers, presumably Salamoni, shouted “He’s got a gun! Gun!” prompting his partner to pull out his service pistol and fire several shots. The US Department of Justice is leading a criminal investigation into the case, joined by the FBI and state police of Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Baton Rouge Police Department over the response to the protests that followed. “The lawsuit alleges that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to disperse protesters who were gathered peacefully to speak out against the police killing of Alton Sterling,” the ACLU said in a statement. The shooting led to massive protests against police violence in the US. One of the demonstrations spilled into yet more bloodshed. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 while guarding a rally against excessive use of force by police. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Micah Johnson, used a sniper rifle while targeting officers in what was reported to be a revenge attack for police killings of black people. \"We\\'re convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement – make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement\\'s efforts to punish people of color,\" Dallas Police Chief David said following the incident. Following a standoff with law enforcers Johnson was shot dead. He had served as a reservist in the army until April 2015 and was also deployed to Afghanistan from November 2003 to July 2014. Officials noted that they did not believe the man was part of a terrorist organization and that the assault was a lone-wolf attack. ']\n",

Putin then accused the West of destabilizing the region – citing the Arab Spring in 2011 as a key flashpoint for tensions that still dominate the Muslim world. “I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries,” said Putin. “Remember how everyone rushed to support the Arab Spring? Where is that optimism now? How did it all end? Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our western partners’ forces?” Putin linked the volatility in the region to the recent spate of large-scale terrorist attacks in the West, which have either been planned or inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have thrived in the chaos. “[Before the Arab Spring] these Middle Eastern countries were not examples of democracies as we understand the word today, and there probably was a need and possibility to influence these societies’ organization, the state organization, and the nature of these regimes,” said Putin, who was attending a festival dedicated to Sambo, a Russian combat sport. “But whatever the case, these states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d’Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.” Putin also detailed his version of the breakdown of the long-negotiated joint operation between Washington and Moscow in Syria, claiming the key turning point was the September 16 US-led coalition strike on a Syrian army unit, which the Pentagon maintains was accident. “Our American colleagues told us that this airstrike was made in error. This error cost the lives of 80 people and, also just coincidence, perhaps, ISIS took the offensive immediately afterwards. At the same time, lower down the ranks, at the operations level, one of the American military service personnel said quite frankly that they spent several days preparing this strike. How could they make an error if they were several days in preparation?” said Putin. “This is how our ceasefire agreement ended up broken. Who broke the agreement? Was it us? No.” Several western powers have since blamed Russia for what they claim was a retaliatory strike on a UN convoy on September 20. Washington has now broken off any bilateral talks with Moscow over Syria. But Putin says that Russia is still open to helping resolve what the UN has termed the worst humanitarian crisis since the war – which has likely killed over 400,000 people – began five years ago. “It has been proposed that our armed units, Russian military personnel, be deployed on the road to ensure transit safety [for aid convoys to Aleppo]. The Russian military, who are courageous and decisive people, have said they would do it,” said Putin, who said that the initiative, which had not previously been made public, was an “exotic proposal.” “But I told them that this could only be done jointly with the US, and ordered them to make the proposal. We have proposed this, and they [the Americans] promptly refused. They do not want to deploy their troops there, but they also do not want to pull back opposition groups – who are, in fact, terrorists. What can we do in this situation?” Despite the downbeat tone of the interview, Putin insisted he was still “optimistic” about a diplomatic solution in Syria, and claimed that the offer to “reschedule” next week’s visit to France, which was canceled following a diplomatic snub by Francois Hollande, was genuine. “This is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo. But we are always open, of course, to any consultations and dialogue on this matter,” said Putin. WATCH MORE:  ']\n",

Asked whether “the federal government has the refugee situation under control,” 81 percent of Germans answered “No,” with just 18 percent saying “Yes.” Those answering “No” also included members of Merkel’s Christian Social Union, with a notable 67 percent of the party’s voters unhappy with the chancellor’s policies. Voter support for Merkel’s government dropped from 57 percent in July 2015 to 38 percent on February 2016 – “the worst estimate during the current government’s term,” the pollster said. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which advocates an anti-immigrant agenda became the third most influential party. It was projected to get 12 percent of the vote if the federal election were held this Sunday. Most Germans also think more restrictive measures towards refugees and asylum seekers must follow. A remarkable 88 percent believe the government should curb benefits for refugees who fail or are unwilling to integrate into German society, with 10 percent saying “No” – a measure previously announced by Germany’s Labor Minister Andrea Nahles. Introducing tougher border control on the EU’s external frontiers and a more detailed processing of asylum seeker applications, debated over the past months in Germany, was also widely supported. Some 63 percent said “Yes” to install the EU’s external border, while 33 percent were opposed. Consequently, 53 percent of Germans said border controls within EU countries – seen as threatening the Schengen border-free zone by many in Brussels – should be introduced as well. According to 77 percent of respondents Europe must also set up refugee centers at the EU’s external borders to process migrants’ applications and send back ineligible asylum seekers. The poll came alongside the so-called “Asylum package II” (Asylpaket II) – the newest set of measures by the German government designed to toughen refugee policies. The package includes putting limits on the number of asylum seekers admitted to Europe, and also an attempt to integrate those who have already reached Germany. Refugees will have to take integration courses, costing €10 a month.

READ MORE: ‘American exceptionalism’ hampers its war on terror – Lavrov “Any unbiased and educated person would see that this statement by Obama is an almost exact copy of leading politicians and propaganda specialists of the Third Reich, including Adolph Hitler… In essence, Obama is using the exact same thing that Nazi bosses said about the German exceptionalism when they started the world war,” he added. The judge also said that in his view the exceptionalism concept had direct influence on the modern US concepts of military planning and these concepts see the main objective of all activities as reaching such degree of military might that the United States remains out of reach of other nations, on land, sea, in air and in space. According to Zorkin, the same applies to the US doctrines on development of mass media and electronic communications – the US authorities see their goal as establishing absolute global domination of their country in the global information space. This idea also constantly appears in Obama’s public speeches. “Obama says that Americans and the USA are an exceptional people and an exceptional state and thus they can pretend for much more than any other people or state. In other words, he follows the plot of James Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ dystopia and, while formally not rejecting the principle of equality of sovereign states and peoples, fixed by the UN Charter, he still declares that Americans and America are ‘more equal’ than any other country and the rest of the planet’s population,” RIA Novosti quoted the judge as saying. Zorkin also told his colleague at the forum that he considered such approach to be a blatant violation of international legal norms. Russian politicians and officials have repeatedly addressed the topic of American exceptionalism when talking on bilateral relations with the US and of international politics in general. In particular, in mid-2015 President Vladimir Putin said in his speech before the UN General Assembly that attempts to influence internal politics of sovereign nations should not be tolerated regardless of where they are taking place and who are making such attempts.

It would be “fatal to now narrow the focus to the military, and seek a remedy solely through a policy of deterrence,” German FM said, calling to give way to diplomacy instead of military posturing. Calling for dialogue and a diplomatic approach, Steinmeier also mentioned the necessity of maintaining military preparedness of NATO. The alliance should also consider the possibility to “renew discussions about the benefits of disarmament and arms control for security in Europe,” he said. The Anaconda drills have become NATO’s largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War, bringing to Poland over 31,000 troops from 24 NATO member states and “partner nations,” including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and others. Moscow has once again pointed out that augmentation of NATO military presence in Eastern Europe and Baltics is unjustified, stressing that Russia has no plans whatsoever to interfere with any country in the region. “I am convinced that every serious and honest politician is well aware that Russia will never invade any NATO member.

The NATO summit in Warsaw is set to put “Russian threat” issue high on the agenda, as the gathering will be making the final decision on stationing additional NATO troops in Eastern Europe. More NATO troops deployed to Poland will be sending “a clear signal that an attack on Poland will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance,” the bloc’s Secretary General told reporters following his meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June. The statements made by NATO leadership put Russian diplomats in a position where they have to deny the obvious. “During the NATO secretary general’s recent visit to Poland, officials in this country [Poland] made statements suggesting that from now on Russia would know that any attack on Poland would mean an attack on NATO as a whole.

The conflict in Ukraine, caused by a bloody coup supported by the US and its European NATO allies, was forced on that country “to substantiate the very existence of the North Atlantic alliance,” the Russian president concluded.

It would be on paper, but whether or not police officers will do it will be another thing, because of the culture of policing in our society,” Ronald Hampton of the National Police Accountability Project told RT America. “It is not about, if you see a police officer doing something wrong, another police officer more than likely would not do anything and [would] come to his or her behalf, rather than report them for doing something improper, or even intervene.” Hampton said the Washington, DC code says that a police officer has a duty to respond or intervene if anyone is committing a crime. It does not exempt police officers. What is missing, however, are protections for officers who choose to blow the whistle on their colleagues, and measures the department should take to prevent officer-on-officer harassment, he added. Hampton thinks it would be more fruitful to codify those measures in the Maryland criminal code. Rawlings-Blake told reporters that city residents never tell her that they want \"an aggressive police department; they say they want an effective police department.\" The announcement of the new policy comes just as the US Justice Department is about to release the results of a sweeping investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s patterns and practices.

He is committed to the sanctity of life.” Trump’s stance on abortion has been questioned due to differing, and sometimes conflicting, statements he has made on abortion laws. Trump said in April that he would support a ban on abortion, but with some exceptions for victims of rape and to save the life of a mother. A month prior, however, he had said that a woman who undergoes an abortion should receive some kind of punishment. Pence reminded the crowd that the next president would be in the position to appoint Supreme Court justices. “While we’re choosing a president for the next four years, this next president will make decisions that will impact our Supreme Court for the next 40,” he said.

The slowest contraction of the second quarter was seen in June, at 0.5 percent, but excluding seasonal factors like cheaper crops and lower demand for coal and gas, the economy did not shrink during the month, said the ministry. The Ministry of Economic Development has forecast that Russia’s GDP will contract by 0.2 percent this year, improving to zero percent in the third quarter, and 1.2 percent growth in the fourth if oil prices average $40 per barrel. The Finance Ministry doesn’t rule out that the economy will grow if the positive situation in the external economic environment continues through the end of the year. On Thursday, Bloomberg wrote that, based on a poll of its economists, Russia is exiting its longest recession in 20 years. Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. Crude prices fell from $114 in July of 2014 to decade lows of $27 per barrel this January, before rebounding to the $45-$50 range this summer. The country is hoping to diversify its economy by developing its agriculture sector, which has shown steady growth over the past two years. Russia has become the world’s biggest wheat exporter, overtaking the US and Canada, and wants to sell 25 million tons of wheat abroad this year. ']\n",

It also claimed that then-foreign secretary Philip Hammond had “raised the importance of compliance with IHL with the Saudi Government during his visit to the region late May, emphasising the importance for thorough and conclusive investigations of alleged IHL breaches to be conducted.” The government asserted that it has a “key test” in place in relation to “our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia,” which determines “whether there is a clear risk that the items to be licensed might be used in a serious violation of IHL.” “Having regard to all the information available to us, we assess that this test has not been met. The Government is therefore satisfied that extant licences for Saudi Arabia are compliant with the UK’s export licensing criteria,” it argued. NGOs dealing with Britain’s global arms trade have not taken the government’s response well. Within hours, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) spokesman Andrew Smith issued a statement. “Despite overwhelming evidence that Saudi forces have broken international humanitarian law, the government has continued to arm and support the regime,” he said. “We are always being told how ‘rigorous’ and ‘robust’ UK arms export controls supposedly are, but the decision to keep arming Saudi shows how hollow those words are. There is a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and the UK government has been complicit in it,” Smith added. In early July, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a 59-page report titled “Bombing Businesses: Saudi Coalition Airstrikes on Yemen’s Civilian Economic Structures.” The document made a detailed study of 17 airstrikes on 13 civilian economic sites, including factories, warehouses, a farm, and two power facilities. Those facilities had employed some 2,500 people before the airstrikes, after which many ceased operations. Up to 130 people were killed and 171 injured in the attacks. ']\n",

            "['7 Mar, 2016 16:09 ', 'How EU & NATO exploited Ukraine to serve their own geopolitical goals', 'op-edge', \"Was it: (a) Vladimir Putin (b) Sergey Lavrov(c) Viktor Yanukovich (d) Jean Claude-Juncker If the correct answer were (a) or (b), western journalists and pro-Kiev regime activists - which are frequently indistinguishable - would be lining up to dismiss the quote as “Russian propaganda.” Or “Hybrid War.” Or whatever this month’s agreed catchphrase/Twitter hashtag is. As it happens, Russia has been consistent on one particular point since Kiev’s ’Orange revolution,’ back in 2004 - that the US's primary objective is to exploit Ukraine’s fratricidal divisions to serve its own geopolitical goals. Which Moscow believes are to push\\xa0American forces as close to Russia’s borders as possible, in the name of ‘containment.’ Two things have prevented this plan from fully succeeding. Firstly Ukraine's internal conflicts. Capital city protestors, aided by Galician allies, have now removed two eastern-dominated governments. The second of which was fairly elected. As sentiment in Kiev and Lviv doesn't reflect the entire country, the regimes these demonstrations created have been unable to consolidate popular, nationwide, support. For example, current President Petro Poroshenko, now enjoys lower\\xa0approval ratings than his ousted predecessor, Viktor Yanukovich, had before Maidan. The other barrier has been many NATO and EU members’ reluctance to countenance full Ukrainian membership of their institutions. Thus, Ukraine is drip-fed with aid, and warm words of praise, while getting no closer to joining either club. It’s instructive to note that NATO is more than willing to supply\\xa0military assistance and funding to Ukraine, but, despite heavy lobbying from the likes of Bernard-Henri Levy, a ‘Marshall plan’-esque economic strategy remains unfathomable to western leaders. We hear plenty of, often bellicose, Washington solidarity with Ukraine’s army, but very little about its pensioners, who are expected to\\xa0survive on average payments of just $14.07 a week, at current exchange rates. This compares to $40.51 in\\xa0Bulgaria and $41.25 in\\xa0Russia, where utilities are significantly cheaper. A guess at (c) would also be incorrect. Yanukovich might have been a terribly corrupt and weak President, but, back in 2013, he did, belatedly, realize one thing: the EU association agreement, which he pulled back from signing, would become an unmitigated disaster for Ukraine. That’s because it involved sacrificing ties with the country’s biggest trading partner, Russia, and replacing them with a far less certain alternative. Free trade with the EU is largely useless to Ukraine, as things stand. For the past two decades, the country’s ruling classes have stolen everything they could, and moved that money\\xa0abroad. As a consequence, there has been little or no investment in modernizing Ukrainian industry. That means its products are of insufficient quality to compete in cutthroat European markets. Confusingly, many activists at Maidan seemed to believe that EU accession was on the cards for Ukraine. It never was. A free trade pact, heavily loaded in Brussel’s favor, was all that was available. By contrast, Russia offered\\xa0$15 billion and a 30% discount on gas. This was in response to an IMF demand that Ukraine raise utility prices and slash public spending in return for a bail-out. Post-coup, Ukraine was forced into the latter scenario by default. Since then, nominal GDP has\\xa0fallen from $183 billion to around $90 billion. Meanwhile, public debt was 94% of GDP in 2015 and annual salaries now average about $2,000, the lowest in Europe. On January 1st, foreign reserves stood at a meagre $12.5 billion. You’re surely guessed by now that (d) Jean-Claude Juncker is our man. The President of the EU Commission was\\xa0speaking in the Netherlands, where a referendum on the EU-Ukraine free-trade agreement will be held in April. While trying to assuage the fears of Dutch voters about more, unpopular, easterly EU expansion, he let the cat out of the bag about where Ukraine stands with Eurocrats. In the heady days of late 2013, EU leaders, like the ultimately deposed, pro-American\\xa0pair of Carl Bildt and Radoslaw Sikorski,\\xa0gave Maidan protestors the impression that Brussels was open to Ukrainian membership. Even now, Kiev has NGOs devoted to EU integration and we’ve heard endless talk of Ukraine’s\\xa0 “European choice.” As an aside, given that the EU only controls 44% of the continent’s land area, it’s endlessly amusing when activists say ‘Europe’ when they mean the EU. Juncker's words, though an example of rare sincerity from a Eurocrat, are a kick in the teeth to Kiev’s EU-integrationists. While he’s merely confirming what smart analysts have already known for a long time, the fact that someone of his stature is openly dismissing Ukrainian ambitions is highly significant. The EU Commission President acknowledged that the EU had enlarged too quickly in the past and insisted Brussels “will not make that mistake again.” Interestingly, it could be argued that the haste to admit Romania and Bulgaria back in 2007, and the British media reaction to it, created the circumstances for this year’s Brexit vote. For that reason, the behavior of the UK authorities during Maidan was always quite amusing. We’ve seen Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond promote the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, while simultaneously admitting he’d\\xa0vote to remove his own country from Brussel's orbit. The hypocrisy is mind blowing. Ukrainians are living under the illusion that their country is on the road to EU membership and acceptance into the western political and economic system. To achieve these aspirations, they are enduring great sacrifices. The problem is that the EU elite doesn’t want Ukraine to join the club. It’s too big, too corrupt, too poor and too close to Russia. It’s time Kiev’s legislative, and oligarchic, elite told their people the truth. Ukraine’s ‘European choice’ is a fraud, built on false promises.

The US president stressed that the ongoing advance of Syrian armed forces and Kurdish militia, with support from the Russian Air Force, could “undermine our collective efforts in northern Syria to degrade and defeat ISIL.” While advising Erdogan to show “reciprocal restraint” and avoid shelling northern Syria where Ankara is engaging Kurds, Obama stressed that “YPG forces should not seek to exploit circumstances in this area to seize additional territory.” At the same time both leaders called on Moscow and Damascus to halt airstrikes against what they call “moderate opposition forces.” Russia has on numerous occasions denied striking civilian targets, and has repeatedly offered its air support to opposition fighters. Russia\\'s Foreign and Defense Ministries have also repeatedly asked Washington to provide a list of the groups it considers “moderate” enough. The US also ignored calls to share intelligence on Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) positions or to join a wider coalition of an anti-terrorist force. While the Kurdish groups, supported by the United States in the fight against IS in northern Syria, are considered one of the most effective ground forces in fighting jihadists in the area, Ankara regards them as terrorists. Vowing retaliation in both Syria and Iraq for the Ankara bombing earlier this week, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu promised to continue to bomb the Kurds, including PKK bases in northern Iraq and YPG positions in northern Syria. Ankara also made it clear that it expects cooperation from its NATO allies to assist Ankara in this fight. Following the bombing in Ankara, Erdogan promised to hunt the perpetrators “everywhere” possible. Prior to speaking with Obama, Erdogan announced that American weapons were being used against civilians by the YPG. The State Department has refuted the claims, with spokesman Mark Toner saying: \"We have also seen no evidence to substantiate the claim that the YPG is somehow smuggling US weapons to the PKK.\" Earlier in the day, Washington rejected a Russian draft resolution at the UN Security Council condemning any plans for foreign military intervention in Syria. Ambassador Samantha Power even accused Moscow of trying to “distract the world” with its resolution. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the discussions with Moscow on the ceasefire in Syria are “near-constant” and have been “serious and so far constructive.” “Everyone recognizes the complexity of this endeavor, and there is certainly a lot more work to do. These discussions have been serious and so far constructive, with a few tough issues still to resolve,” Kerry said in London as quoted by Reuters. He has been in contact with the US Syria team, which is in Geneva and said the negotiations have been ongoing for the past 36 hours. “Working out modalities for a cessation of hostilities in a situation like Syria is a highly technical and detailed process; and that\\'s why our teams are still at it. We want this process to be sustainable, and should all participants prove willing to really sit down and work this out, we can get to a cessation of hostilities.” Kerry briefly stopped in London en route to Jordan where he is to discuss Syria with King Abdullah over the weekend. The proximity talks launched in Geneva in February have been delayed with an indefinite date of restart, according to UN special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura. On Friday, de Mistura’s office said it would provide a new date for the meeting in Geneva \"as soon as possible.\" De Mistura told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that the peace talks won\\'t resume in Geneva on February 25 as he had hoped. He said he can’t \"realistically\" get the parties in the Syrian conflict back to negotiations by that time. However, he added that he hopes the parties will gather “soon.” “We need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks. Now the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities,” he said in the interview on Thursday. At the beginning of February, the United Nations temporarily suspended peace talks aimed at resolving Syria’s five-year civil war. The UN said the process was to be resumed on February 25 and called on the sides involved to do more to achieve progress. An ambitious plan to end hostilities in Syria with verifiable results within a week, revived the Geneva-3 peace talks, when Kerry and Lavrov unveiled the truce plan in Munich last Friday. While the humanitarian aid has begun flowing into besieged towns in Syria this week, the warring sides have yet to end hostilities. ']\n",
            "['5 Apr, 2016 20:31 ', 'WhatsApp rolls out end-to-end encryption for its billion users', 'usa', 'WhatsApp announced Tuesday that messages sent over the service are only stored in a meaningless hash on WhatsApp servers by default. The update took a year and a half to roll out, and affects the messaging service’s billion users. The announcement from the company, which is a subsidiary of Facebook, comes amid something of cold war between Silicon Valley and the US government on matters of encryption and privacy. The highest-profile instance of this faceoff happened between Apple and the FBI, where the government initiated a legal battle to force the company to open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. The litigation abruptly ended last month because the FBI managed to break into the phone using an unknown method without Apple’s help. While the timing may seem perfect in the wake of that controversy, WhatsApp has been in the process of strengthening privacy since November 2014, when it partnered with Open Whisper Systems to implement the nonprofit’s encryption protocols. “The desire to protect people’s private communication is one of the core beliefs we have at WhatsApp, and for me, it’s personal,” Ukrainian-born WhatsApp founder Jan Koum\\xa0wrote in a Tuesday blog post. “I grew up in the USSR during communist rule and the fact that people couldn’t speak freely is one of the reasons my family moved to the United States.” The new privacy standards could affect the messenger’s one billion users, but the end-to-end encryption is reliant on all communicants being upgraded to the software’s latest version. The WhatsApp client will notify users as to whether or not their messages are fully encrypted. While the company’s blog post calls encryption “one of the most important tools governments, companies, and individuals have to promote safety and security in the new digital age,” many in the US government have sought to undermine encryption on the basis of national security concerns. WhatsApp has been in the crosshairs of authorities before, and in March the service’s messaging encryption thwarted a court-approved wiretap. READ MORE: ISIS using Android app to send encrypted messages, plan attacks On Monday, Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that he would soon unveil legislation that would regulate encrypted communications. In July, FBI Director Jim Comey pushed for the tech industry to create “backdoor” keys to bypass encrypted software. In their blog post, WhatsApp’s founders gestured at the government’s enmity with encryption, assuring users that “no one can see inside the message.” “Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us,” the blog post reads. ']\n",

The intelligence gave critical insight into IS’ pivot to Iraq and Syria, and included GPS coordinates, maps, photographs, phone numbers and even IP addresses, \"M\" said. “From the moment Daesh (an Arabic pejorative acronym for IS) had 20 members to when it had 20,000, we have shown everything to the Americans. When we asked them what they did with this information, they always gave evasive answers, saying it was in the hands of decision-makers.” The FSA’s intelligence chief, “trained abroad” according to the newspaper, had recruited thirty trusted men, who were inserted into IS-held cities in Syria, including Raqqa, Al-Bab, Tel Abyad and others. To finance operations, the spy chief requested $30,000 per month from the Americans, but he says he only received $10,000. One of M’s most valuable agents was a mole inside Islamic State’s financial unit in Manbij near the Turkish border. A report from him, seen by Le Monde, described payments of $74,000 (€67,000) from a former parliamentarian called Radwan Habib to his brother Ali – an IS “emir” in Maskaneh in Aleppo governorate. FSA agents and informants conducted various operations, often risky ones. One photo \"M\" shared with the newspaper showed a training camp north of Latakia province frequented by foreign IS fighters. “Naturally I transmitted this to my Western contacts with the GPS coordinates but got no response,” he was cited as saying. “My agents also managed to get hold of phone numbers of IS officials, serial numbers of [their] satellite equipment and IP addresses. But once again, zero response.” Another FSA document accessed by the French newspaper included an order of battle designed to expel IS from Aleppo province in summer 2014. Postponed several times by the Americans, the attack was eventually torpedoed at end of 2014 by a surprise counterattack by Al-Nusra Front. The Free Syrian Army was founded by a group of deserters, including officers and soldiers from the Syrian Army, in July 2011. It received substantial military aid from the US and Britain for its anti-Assad stance. In June 2012, the CIA was involved in clandestine operations along the Turkish-Syrian border, according to a Wall Street Journal report. They were identifying rebel groups to give military aid to. CIA operatives also helped opposition forces develop supply routes and provided communications training. Agents also reportedly distributed assault rifles, anti-tank rocket launchers and other ammunition to the Syrian opposition. Throughout 2013 and 2014, the CIA was said to be training “moderate” Syrian opposition fighters at Jordanian special forces’ bases in anticipation of President Assad’s fall. By 2015, Washington had scaled down most programs to train and equip Syrian rebels. However, other secret and significantly larger programs run by Langley still continue despite significant cuts, the Washington Post reported. ']\n",

Slahi’s book, ‘Guantanamo Diary,’ describes in highly redacted yet dramatic style his incredible ordeal from the moment his rendition plane landed in Cuba, where he and other detainees faced abuse, torture and other atrocities. Once on the island, Slahi was forced into solitary confinement where he says he “was on the edge of losing his mind.” The diary describes how Slahi was subjected to sleep deprivation, death threats, sexual humiliation and intimations. Yet Slahi’s revelations are almost singular. The government has prevented other detainees ‒ like Ammar al Baluchi, one of the few men at Gitmo who has been charged with a crime ‒ from talking about what happened to them… even to their own lawyers. The government “has classified Mr. al Baluchi’s own memories of what happened to him, to prevent him from providing information that would allow someone, somewhere to seek accountability,” James Connell, one of al Baluchi’s lawyers, told RT. Exactly 10 years ago Friday, criminal investigators learned of the first deaths from inside Gitmo. “There’s some sort of dark history in the past that has happened before the DOD has taken over and so people have concerns,” Navy Captain Christopher Scholl told RT America. “If you google images for Guantanamo Bay, often images of Camp X-Ray from the first 92 days ‒ 14 years ‒ ago comes up, and the media keeps on using” those images. But now, he says, it’s a completely different picture. Gitmo opened as a prison at the US naval base in Cuba under the administration of President George W. Bush following the attacks of September 11, 2001. President Barack Obama promised during his 2008 campaign that he would close the infamous detention center in Cuba. It’s a promise he’s, as yet, been unable to keep thanks, in part, to strong opposition in Congress. Of the 779 men who have been held there, only 80 detainees remain ‒ 28 of whom are cleared for release ‒ but the conditions they face and what might happen to them in the future remain unclear. For a special report airing Friday, RT America’s Simone Del Rosario went to Guantanamo Bay to investigate if and how the prison would be shut down, and to see in what conditions those detainees are living. What happens, she asks, when you reach the irreducible minimum, the dozens of forever prisoners deemed too dangerous to release? “There’s a distinction between detainees and prisoners, prisoners are held with an objective of rehabilitating them from the behavior that led to the previous crime,” Admiral Peter Clarke, commander of Gitmo, told RT. “These are law of war detainees who are here because at one point they made it their job to try to kill Americans.” The focus now is on what to do with the population, especially as the detainees age. Del Rosario takes a look inside the detention facilities currently being used, to see what the cells look like. She talks to current and former guards deployed at Gitmo, those tasked with taking care of “the worst of the worst.” She also speaks with lawyers for two men who are still detained in Cuba, one who has been cleared for release and one of the few who has actually been charged with a crime. What will happen to them if Obama is able to fulfill his campaign promise during his final days in office? Will the upcoming presidential election change their future?

He offered to help African-American people during Hurricane Katrina, where Black people were floating up and down the streets for a week out here in the US. He offered to help, he was turned down.

            "['31 Aug, 2016 14:31 ', 'Top 7 ways America has alienated Vladimir Putin (and vice-versa)', 'op-edge', 'A cursory glance at Putin’s track record should convince even the most jaded Russian observer that he has done everything possible to build solid relations with the United States. Yet not only has the Obama administration refused to meet Putin halfway, it characterizes the Russian leader as the global arch villain bar none. So here’s a refresher course for anybody who’s ever dragged Putin’s name through the mud, serving up piping hot propa-garbage while helping to exasperate tensions between Russia and the US. As Vladimir Nabokov once proclaimed before considering an entirely different subject, “Look at this tangle of thorns”. It is no secret that following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 against the US, Putin was the first global leader to telephone US President George W. Bush. And he didn\\'t call collect. Moreover, the Russian leader offered more than just words of condolence. He pushed through a raft of legislation to assist the US in the fight against terrorism. In his 2011 book, “Vladimir Putin and Russian Statecraft,” Allen C. Lynch documented Putin’s contributions to America’s endless ‘War on Terror’. “In a bold decision… Putin made Russia the most important U.S. ally in the war against the Taliban,” Lynch wrote. “Among other things, he accelerated deliveries of weapons to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan so that when the Alliance marched into Kabul it did so with Russian, not American, weapons and vehicles. He encouraged the governments of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to allow American military bases on their territory.” And here is my personal favorite: “He opened Russian airspace for American overflights to bases in Central Asia so that the US could conduct search and rescue operations for U.S. airmen (Please imagine the howl of pain that would echo across Washington if any US president allowed Russian military overflights across US territory into South America!). Despite Putin’s extreme generosity bestowed upon the US military and intelligence apparatus, Washington proved Graham Greene’s adage “there is no such thing as gratitude in politics” by ratcheting up pressure against Russia for no good reason whatsoever. According to Stephen Cohen, the US\\xa0repaid Putin for his “extraordinary assistance” by “further expanding NATO to Russia’s borders and by unilaterally withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which Moscow regarded as the linchpin of its nuclear security.”\\xa0 With friends like this who needs enemies? After spending prodigious amounts of money, material and manpower fighting fundamentalists in the desert, some might be tempted to think the US would relish any opportunity to avoid another military misadventure. If you believed that, you haven’t been paying attention to what’s been occurring in the Middle East since 2002 with the US invasion of Afghanistan. Future historians (that is, assuming there is a future where historians may ponder the past) may one day mark August 29, 2013 as the day when the American Empire first started showing signs of wear and tear. That was when UK Prime Minister David Cameron failed to secure approval in the House of Commons to join yet another US-led serial killing, this time in Syria, after President Bashar Assad\\xa0purportedly crossed Obama’s whimsical “red line” and used chemical weapons against the Syrian opposition (an assertion that was never proven). This placed the Obama administration in a bind, eventually leading to a ‘slip of the tongue’ by US Secretary of State John Kerry, who remarked that Syria could avoid an American blitzkrieg if it agreed to surrender its chemical weapons “within one week”. Infuriatingly for the US neocons, Putin successfully\\xa0convinced Damascus to remove its chemical weapons with all due haste. NATO missile defense goes live in Europe, isolating Russia not the goal – Stoltenberg https://t.co/hzCkN3l7yw#WSEF16 Predictably, however, US media and thinktankdom portrayed Putin’s eleventh-hour diplomacy, which delayed the obliteration of yet another Middle East state, as some sort of geopolitical ploy. \"It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,\" Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution,\\xa0told CNN. I was almost expecting Fiona to employ some sort of judo analogy next. Oh wait, she did. \"If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin\\'s favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,\" she said. \"And right now, he\\'s managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.\" Think about that. If that was the best press Putin could get when he helped America to avoid yet another military smash-up, chances are negligible that he would ever get positive reviews under normal circumstances. And therein, dear reader, lies the rub: America has come to the psychotic point in its foreign policy when avoiding military conflict is actually viewed as a setback. In May, the US put the finishing touches on its Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System in Romania, the culmination of a decades-worth of\\xa0disingenuous negotiations with Moscow. Washington’s determination to build this system, which Moscow naturally views as a major security threat smoking on its doorstep, has completely upset the strategic balance in the region. Russia is now forced to respond to this system with more powerful and elusive ballistic missiles. In other words, our tiny, fragile planet, thanks to the surrogate mother of global upheaval and chaos, Lady Liberty, is experiencing the birth pains of another arms race between the world’s two nuclear superpowers. This did not have to be. Early in his presidency, Obama\\xa0announced he would “scrap” the Bush administration\\'s defense system, slated for Poland and the Czech Republic, after it was determined that Iran was not the existential threat to Eastern Europe that his predecessor had touted it as. This seemed to indicate an open window of opportunity for Russia-US cooperation (in fact, the fate of the New START nuclear disarmament treaty, signed into force between Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama on April 8, 2010, hinged on bilateral cooperation). Russia even proposed the two countries share the Qabala Radar in Azerbaijan, which Russia leased at the time, but the US rejected the proposal even though it made more tactical sense. Eventually, it became maddeningly apparent that the US was bluffing, dangling the carrot of mutual cooperation with Russia at the same time a new missile defense system was moving forward. In November, Putin rightly\\xa0accused the US of attempting to “neutralize Russia’s nuclear potential” by camouflaging their real designs behind Iran and North Korea. “The US is attempting to achieve strategic military superiority, with all the consequences that entails,” he said. Obama’s failure to cooperate with Putin on this game-changing system has been the real source of bad blood between the two nuclear superpowers. In September 2015, following an official request by the Syrian government, Russia\\xa0launched a formidable aerial attack on Islamic State positions in Syria. Russia went on to provide ample video evidence of its success against ISIS, not only hitting its command and control centers, but destroying its makeshift oil exporting business. Oddly, Moscow’s request for assistance in providing logistics on terrorist positions was rebuked by Western governments. In fact, the only thing Putin got from the United States for his labors in Syria was a lamentable\\xa0lecture by US Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter: “This will have consequences for Russia itself, which is rightly fearful of attacks,” Carter said before uttering a regrettable prediction. “In coming days, the Russians will begin to suffer from casualties.” Coincidentally, throughout the course of Russia’s military offensive in Syria, it has only lost a single fighter jet and a number of servicemen. But not to Islamic State or some other nefarious group. The jet was shot down by Turkey, the first time a NATO member engaged a Russian aircraft in over 50 years. Despite whatever Monsanto lobbyists may tell our representatives in Congress, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed - on moral, ethical and health grounds - to genetically modified foods. In a survey of US residents representative of the population on gender, age, and income, 64 percent opposed GMO, and 71 percent of GMO opponents said they were “absolutely” opposed—that is, they agreed that GM should be prohibited no matter the risks and benefits. Yet this clear demonstration of public opinion has not translated into any sort of democratic ability to pull GMO ‘Frankenstein foods’ from the shelves. What is all the more incredible about America’s willingness to begrudgingly accept genetically modified foods is that the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) performs no tests on such products. As Jason Dietz, a policy analyst at FDA, explained: “It’s the manufacturer’s responsibility to insure that the product is safe.” However, companies like Monsanto are under no obligation to test their products for safety considerations; the process is completely voluntary.  “Well, the companies are supposed to do a voluntary consultation,” Michael Hansen, a critic of GM foods at the Consumers Union,\\xa0told Grist. “[B]ut it’s voluntary. Look at what the FDA says when they approve a food: ‘It is our understanding that Monsanto has concluded this is safe.’ They just rubber-stamp it.” While Americans are being essentially used as laboratory test bunnies, paying good money to consume products that may or may not kill them, Putin refuses to play Russian roulette with his peoples’ health. In June, Putin\\xa0approved a bill that bans all genetically engineered foods from entering Russia. The legislation includes stiff fines for producing GMO products in Russia or importing them from abroad, with the exception of genetically altered organisms and materials used for expertise and research. Meanwhile, Americans will be happy to know that Russia is offering a healthy alternative to what the global food corporations are delivering. In his state of the nation speech on December 3 in the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin said, “We can not only feed ourselves, Russia can become an important global supplier of healthy, organic and high-quality food, especially since the global demand for such products is showing a steady growth.” Since many Westerners will never have an opportunity to visit Russia, their perceptions of this relatively distant country are largely shaped for them by journalists, the majority of whom are predisposed to a form of self-imposed censorship that is constantly whispering in their ear that Russia must never appear attractive to their readers, lest they want to lose their jobs. Thus, whenever news travels from Russia across the ocean to Western audiences, it is inevitably tainted by misconceptions, misinformation and outright lies. A classic example of this is the Western media outcry following Putin’s so-called ‘anti-gay’ legislation, which is in fact ‘pro-children’ legislation. Putin patiently\\xa0explained the legislation in an interview with World Media: \"[…] All people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Everybody is equal. We have recently only passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality only, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. But this has nothing in common with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation. And there is a world of difference between these things.\" Personally - and I’ve spoken with many people on this issue who feel the same way - this passage sounds like the Mount Everest of common sense. Why on earth should children be exposed to issues – whether they are of a homosexual, heterosexual, metrosexual or what-have-you-sexual content – at such an early age? There is an appropriate time for such considerations later in life and probably better after puberty. Well, good luck trying to convince the Western media of that. Harvey Fierstein, just prior to the Sochi Olympics, wrote in the New York Times that \"Putin has declared war on homosexuals... allowing police officers to arrest tourists and foreign nationals they suspect of being homosexual, lesbian or “pro-gay” and detain them for up to 14 days.\" Fierstein, an actor and playwright, not a lawyer, continued\\xa0peddling absurdities that \"the law could mean that any Olympic athlete, trainer, reporter, family member or fan who is gay — or suspected of being gay, or just accused of being gay — can go to jail.\" To be honest, this ranks as some of the smelliest anti-Russia rubbish I have ever read (If I may, I would just like to assure readers, and especially the homosexuals, there are no anti-gay goon squads on patrol in Russia, so feel free to pack your rainbow-colored T-shirt). Instead of quoting a Russian source (this may come as a surprise, but Russia does have lawyers) that might just have some insight as to what the law really says, Fierstein\\xa0quoted the Huffington Post, who got their blotched information from an obscure Canadian travel site. So much for investigative journalism. In any case, Putin’s actions on behalf of protecting children (not arresting homosexuals) offer a nice counterbalance to America’s disturbing desire to expose children to overt sexual messages at very young ages. And not just your traditional fireside chats with Dad about the birds and the bees. No, that would be too damm sensible. Today, many American schoolchildren, before they are old enough to lace up their shoes, are being psychologically strip searched, with demands being made upon them to come to terms with their sexuality, with forays into the tall weeds of transgender. Personally, I am grateful for Putin to present an alternative method for addressing such extremely sensitive issues to our children. Although the US continues to enforce a sanctions regime against Russia, which seems, incidentally, to be damaging Western interests far more than Russia’s, Putin continues to let America use Russian rockets to travel to outer space, keeping the US from being a landlocked superpower. Needless to say, this is a rather embarrassing situation for NASA, which must rely on the Atlas V rocket, powered by a Russian rocket engine, to transport its satellite technology into the cosmos.Senator John McCain, a perennial anti-Russia bugbear, recently stormed: “Today, Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground.\" Former NASA administrator Mike Griffin put the problem squarely on Washington’s shoulders, complaining that “Americans spend more annually on pizza ($27 billion USD) than on space.” “Due to such changes NASA’s mission today is much weaker than several decades ago,”wrote Nenad Drca in Modern Diplomacy. “The United States, first to send men to the moon in 1969, now struggles in the 21st century to reach beyond low-earth orbit without expensive Russian assistance. How the mighty have fallen…” All things considered, the United States – and the world - has far more to gain with better relations, not just with Vladimir Putin, but with Russia.

On Friday, seven people, mostly women and children, were killed and at least 24 injured in a terrorist attack on northern Aleppo after militants fired a missile in the area, according to Syria’s state SANA news agency. Lavrov emphasized the importance of all opposition groups being included in the negotiations for the reconciliation process to succeed.“It is the demand of the UN Security Council. Resolution 2254 proclaims that the negotiations should be inclusive, with participation of all Syrian parties, including the groups that have been formed in Moscow, Cairo, El-Riyadh and other places,” he said.

Meanwhile, political analyst Ammar Waqqaf has cast doubt on the sincerity of Kerry’s assertion that “going on Al-Nusra” was never a negotiating point. “United States have made a big decision in ditching Jabhat Al-Nusra to preserve the other fighting groups, the other what they call the moderate fighting groups,” the analyst told RT, calling it the “cornerstone” of the deal. Waqqaf is sure that Washington’s move was prompted by the rapid advance of Syrian armed forces on rebel positions, which would have imminently led to the “severe deterioration” of the so-called moderate forces and hardline terrorist groups, including Al-Nusra, alike. The decision to turn away from the most radical groups was made “to try and tie the Syrian state hand and Russian hand, in order to preserve the other groups who are less extremist but still extremist but they would call them moderate know,” to preserve less extremist rebels.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 The recent Al-Nusra rebranding when the militant group formally severed all ties with Al-Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham could have resulted in its inclusion into the moderate opposition if Washington had not strived to find a compromise with Russia, Waqqaf said. For its part, the Saudi-backed High Negotiating Committee (HNC) issued a statement welcoming the split and encouraging the former Al-Nusra group to commit to further reforms. “Saudi Arabia saw an opportunity to bring Jabhat Al-Nusra, which is a formidable fighting force under their umbrella, and tried to tell the Americans: Look, we can turn this into real moderates and you do not have to bomb them.”\\xa0  However, “Americans knew that there would be no deal with Russian unless Jabhat Al-Nusra is called Jabhat Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda and that they are separate [from moderate rebels].” ']\n",

The official also noted that “surprisingly” Moscow has been among “top issues which the [US] candidates focused on,” while the American public should think of actual problems inside the country like “politics economy, health system.” Relations between Moscow and Washington have been particularly strained in the past month over the alleged Russian hacking attacks against US officials and facilities as well as over the Syrian deadlock. When asked whether the mood in Washington might change after the elections Zakharova stressed that “anti-Russian rhetoric is absolutely a way in nowhere, it is a dead end.” Lots of what is happening on the international arena “depends on the cooperation between our countries,” the spokeswoman said, noting that “numerous international crises and their solutions proved that.” Close cooperation between Moscow and Washington alongside other international partners lead to a historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear program in 2015 after years of negotiations with Tehran. “The more stable a dialogue between Moscow and Washington will be, the more stable will be international relations,” Zakharova concluded.

What should the UN's priority be in dealing with the flow of refugees? António Guterres: Of course we cannot forget the need to protect them, the need to keep borders open for them, the need to make sure that we find solutions for them. But the most important is to increase the prevention of conflicts…Now more that 65 million people are displaced by conflict in the world. And we see this multiplication of new conflicts; we see old conflicts that never die. It is absolutely essential to increase the resources, the capacities, the possibility to mobilize all those that have an influence on the parties to the conflicts in order to prevent those conflict from happening, and then in order to solve them as soon as they happen. This is the biggest flow we have today in the international community capacity. And it is this flow that needs to be addressed with maximum priority, because better than to help refugees is to make sure that there won’t be more refugees in the future. RT: What will your priority be if you’re elected UN secretary-general? AG: I think that we need a surge in the diplomacy for peace. The UN has the role to play as an honest broker, as a convener in a humble way, but helping countries to come together – those that have an influence on different parties to different conflicts to come together to understand that now these are wars in which nobody is winning, everybody is losing. That became a nightmare not only for the countries involved in the war, but for the whole international community.\\xa0\\xa0 We see the connection between global terrorism and conflict. We see attacks in Beirut, in Paris, in Orlando, everywhere… We saw the tragic event with the Russian plane coming from Egypt. So this is something in which now there is a fundamental interest of everybody in the world to come together and to put an end to these conflicts. I see the UN can play a role in helping people come together and doing some discreet diplomacy, facilitating trust being built for the international community to be able to act as a whole and to make sure that we avoid this terrible multiplication of conflicts that we’re witnessing today. RT: The UN has been dealing with global peace and stability for 65 years. With terrorism, the refugee crisis and climate change, is the organization still up to its mission? AG: Obviously. There is still a long way to go. Many people in different UN organizations are doing their best. We see UN agencies delivering humanitarian aid; we see the mobilization of the international community [in response] to climate change in the Paris agreement; we see the new Agenda 2030 in relation to sustainable development. There is progress in many areas. But let’s be clear, there is still a long way to go to create the conditions of trust for all member states to be engaged in the most important objective of them all, which is to establish peace and security in our troubled world. RT: Ban Ki-moon recently said Russia has a very important role to play, and that he counts heavily on its leadership. What's your view on that, as Russia's hasn't been a favorite in the West since the Ukrainian crisis erupted more than two years ago? AG: Well, I do believe that Russia is an absolutely fundamental partner in all international efforts to bring more peace and stability to the world. The coordination, the cooperation between the UN and Russia and creating the conditions to increase also the trust in the relations between Russia and other powers in the world is absolutely crucial. There is no way we can address the problems of today’s world without the strong involvement of Russia. Russia’s role is absolutely essential, absolutely crucial in creating the conditions for us to be able to move forward in all key aspects of international agenda. RT: The EU has reportedly agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia for another six months. But we've heard from many politicians that it's now time to build bridges, not walls. What's your view? AG: We need to increase dialogue between all key players in the international community. Russia is one of these key players; the EU is one of the key players. The US is another key player. There must be better dialogue, better cooperation, better understanding – that is the way forward. RT: When it comes to solving the Syrian crisis, Moscow and Washington seem to agree on many things, but sparks often fly high between their envoys at the Security Council and they often don't see eye to eye. Can they find a new way or working, or are there deep-seated differences that just can't be overcome? AG: I’ve seen Moscow and Washington come together very closely. The two are playing a very important role in creating the conditions for peace to be established in Syria. I believe that effort needs to be enlarged to other countries. Regional powers have today a very important role in the questions of peace and security. It is important to put on board also countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. I believe that Russia and the US are moving in the right direction, but they need to bring onboard other key partners in order to make sure that the comprehensive solution is possible… RT: There has been a refugee deal signed between the EU and Turkey, which key aspect was to solve refugee crisis in Europe. Do you think it works properly? AG: I am not following the deal and its evolution very closely… But the most dramatic scene for me is that the problems are not solved. The central problem is the Syrians that are suffering so much. Seeing the houses bombed, seeing the members of the families being killed, their communities being destroyed. The Syrians are now starting not to have a place to escape, starting not to have international protection evaluable for them in Europe and in the neighborhood. This is something that needs to be corrected. That is why I have been advocating since last year and the UNHCR is advocating today for a massive resettlement program allowing Syrians to be able to restart their lives in different parts of the world with a common international effort to give an adequate answer to this immense tragedy of Syrian people.

Then the explosion rang out. \"It was like an earthquake.

At least 25 children were killed, and the death toll mounted throughout Sunday, as a fire took 12 hours to contain, and rescue services attempted to extract bodies from under the rubble. Almost immediately, the Islamic State terror group boasted that it was behind the attack on its sectarian rivals, calling it a “security operation.” In another Baghdad district, a roadside bomb exploded in a busy market, killing five and injuring 16, in a consistent pattern with Islamic State’s favored tactic of launching multiple near-simultaneous attacks to create a sense of terror.

But few were contented with al-Abadi’s rhetoric, and videos uploaded on the internet showed his cortege being jeered by Karrada residents, with many throwing cans and stones at the armored vehicles.

Established in 2007, USC is the largest shipbuilding company in Russia. The state-owned firm unites shipyards, design offices and ship repair facilities, accounting for 80 percent of the domestic shipbuilding industry. Since Turkey and Egypt became off-limits for Russian tourists, there has been an approximately 800 percent hike in bookings for cruise liners inside the country, according to business daily Kommersant. The most popular destinations are river cruises from Moscow to St. Petersburg and Kazan. Many tourists who chose holiday cruises used to vacation in Europe. But after the ruble depreciated, they simply cannot afford it anymore. The Soviet Union had a fleet of ocean liners that made cruises on the Black and Baltic Seas. These ships were mostly built in East Germany, Finland and Yugoslavia. The vast majority of these vessels, operated in the Soviet era, have now been written off for scrap. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia had troubles with local shipbuilding, as many technologies were lost in the 1990s. According to Rakhmanov, USC is now trying to catch up with something that hasn’t been done in the last 20 to 25 years. One of the main problems of Russian military shipbuilding is the production of engines. Before the deterioration of Moscow’s relationship with Kiev, Russia imported engines from Ukraine. The problem of supplying engines became acute after Kiev decided to sever military-technical cooperation with Moscow. In 2015, the Industry and Trade Ministry promised to substitute Ukrainian engines in 2017 or 2018. ']\n",

The forensic pathologist, Kim Collins, who conducted the autopsy ruled that the manner of Scott’s death was “homicide.” Scott’s family had to resort to private forensics examination after the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) refused to provide their autopsy and toxicology analysis to either the family or the press. “It’s a little frustrating, in this age when we keep talking about transparency,” Charles Monnett, one of the attorneys representing the Scott family, said, as cited by the Post. #Charlotte protesters march on highway on 4th night of demonstrations https://t.co/tIr0rBZAab The police have so far released a statement as well as bodycam and dashcam footage from the September 22 fatal shooting of Scott, following protests and riots in Charlotte. According to the police account, two plainclothes officers were taking part in an unrelated operation when they saw Scott pull up next to them. The two said they saw him rolling a marijuana joint. Then, one of the officers noticed that Scott held “a gun up.” This prompted the officers to leave the area, change into police uniform, and then “take enforcement action for public safety concerns.” At the same time, Scott’s family insists he had not been armed at the time that he was confronted by the two officers. Dashcam footage showed Scott, a father of seven, coming out of his car and walking backwards away from it until he is shot, but it was unclear from the footage whether Scott was holding a gun in his hand. “Was there a gun in his ankle holster? Was there a gun in his hand?” Monnett said, according to the Post. “It’s pretty clear that Keith never discharged a firearm and I think it’s pretty clear from the video that he never pointed any firearm at an officer.” Yet, the police said a gun was found at the scene, and they shared an image, saying it was the weapon Scott was holding.

If they stop, then the terrorists will be weak and leave or be defeated, and then we can sit as Syrians and talk about solutions,” the Syrian president added. Given the dire state of affairs, military support from Russia has been essential, Assad said. “What made the difference, of course, was firepower.

And some from the Iranians; but they didn’t send troops, they sent officers to help.” “At the end we were fighting an unlimited reserve of terrorists coming to Syria and we struggled, so Russian firepower and Iranian support has compensated,” he explained. For decades, Russia has proven to be a loyal and trustworthy ally to Syria that doesn’t put pressure on the country, Assad said. “Of course we make the decisions. The Russian military has been in Syria for six decades. Their policy rests on two things — morals and international law.

Iqbal told RT: “The police escorted us to the front of the plane. At this point the cabin crew had found someone…. and he turned around and said he heard the word ‘bomb.’ Later on he said we played a song with the word ‘bomb’ in it.” The men from Oldham, Manchester, argued that, while they might have been loud, they didn’t use the word “bomb” or sing “anything of the sort.” They also complained that Thomas Cook had no witnesses to back-up their accusations. “The biggest thing is, Thomas Cook can’t bring up one witness against us,” said Ahmed. “They have no proof against us. I don’t understand it. There were people on the flight who were louder than us. We’ve got witnesses saying that. There were people screaming and at the end of the flight we were the only taken off.” Indeed, fellow passenger Pamela Clark told the press: “I never heard anything about bombs. There was no bad behavior or anything like that from them.” The four were eventually allowed to continue with their four-day holiday, but the group found themselves banned from the airline when they arrived back at the airport for their return flight and were all forced to buy a new return flight with a different operator at £125 each. Thomas Cook airlines released a statement saying: “Four individuals were extremely disruptive throughout this flight and were refused carriage on the basis of their abusive behaviour. We do not tolerate such severely disruptive behaviour towards our crew or passengers.” When asked by RT whether they felt extra precautions on flights were justified due to the high risk of terror attacks, Iqbal said he didn’t “sympathize,” as no one but a crew member had come forward with complaints.

The official told the audience that in his view the United States and its allies were waging a “hybrid war” against Russia which included price dumping on energy markets together with “currency wars” in the form of the uncontrolled expansion of the dollar. The alternative proposed by Bastrykin includes the integration of the financial systems of various member-nations of the future coalition, including international centers for the accumulation of investment resources and systems allowing cross-border payments in national currencies.

Our staff are not from another planet,” Younger said. “They are ordinary men and women operating in the face of complex moral, ethical and physical challenges, often in the most forbidding environments on Earth.” “In contrast to James Bond, MI6 officers are not for taking moral shortcuts. In fact, a strong ethical core is one of the first qualities we look for in our staff,” he added. Younger insisted that Bond’s erratic individualism would certainly have rendered him unable to “get through our recruitment process.” “Whilst we share his qualities of patriotism, energy and tenacity, an intelligence officer in the real MI6 has a high degree of emotional intelligence, values teamwork and always has respect for the law... unlike Mr. Bond,” Younger said. Some, however, would contest claims that MI6 is a bastion of ethical conduct, not least during the UK’s heavy involvement in kidnap and torture in the post-9/11 world. A Libyan kidnapped and delivered to the Libyan regime for torture recently questioned the commitment to morality of a previous MI6 head. In July, Abdul Hakim Belhaj said former MI6 chief Mark Allen was mistaken if he thinks a recent article he wrote for a Christian magazine means his “account is settled with God.” In 2004, Abdul Hakim Belhaj was kidnapped in Hong Kong with British complicity, along with his pregnant wife, and rendered back to his native Libya. He was then held and tortured by the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for six years. A note faxed from Allen to the Libyan authorities told the regime’s spy chief Moussa Koussa: “I congratulate you on the safe arrival of… the air cargo.” On August 4, a day before the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided it would not press charges against Allen, the ex-spook published a piece in the Catholic Herald on “Christian” approaches to terrorism. Belhaj’s response, which had been offered to the Herald, was published on the website of the Reprieve human rights charity. “His words on the power of faith to see us through bloodshed are too rich to swallow,” the torture victim wrote in reference to the now infamous ‘air cargo’ fax.

READ MORE: US officials covered up China hack of FDIC computers – House report The networking blunder is present in the Linux kernel, the core of its operating system, and can be exploited by malicious actors to determine whether two systems are communicating with each other, and even inject malicious data into or break their connection. At the symposium, the researchers demonstrated the exploit by injecting code into a live USA Today page that asks visitors to enter their emails and passwords, which was possible because pages on USA Today aren’t encrypted. Perhaps most importantly, the intercepting of data doesn’t require a man-in-the-middle attack, where a connection will covertly intercept, collect and pass forward information between two parties. Instead, attackers can just send packets of data to the two targets with spoofed credentials. “Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the attack is extremely effective and reliable.

The team notes that because only version 3.6 or later of the Linux kernel has the flaw, systems running older software are not affected.

He says he was elected just nine months ago with the support of 60 percent of party members. “I have a huge responsibility, I’m carrying out that responsibility and I’m carrying on with that responsibility.” He says he has had a number of successes on the job, including forcing the Tories to rethink tax credits, police cuts, personal independence payments for people with disabilities and the forced ‘academization’ of schools. “When we do things together we are very strong. Now is the time to come together.” Corbyn said with 60,000 new members joining Labour last week, the party was the highest it had been in his lifetime. “That membership wants and expects all of us to work together in their interests.” There have been reports the beleaguered Labour leader wants to quit, but his allies on the left of the party are persuading him to remain in power.

            "['9 May, 2016 15:37 ', 'Green Party candidates to face off in debate hosted by RT (WATCH LIVE)', 'usa', ' Green Party candidates Jill Stein, Kent Mesplay and Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza Curry are debating\\xa0issues such as foreign policy, electoral reform and domestic policy. We broadcast the debate in 360 on Youtube and on\\xa0our web-site. While the candidates are set to distinguish themselves in terms of strategy and policy goals, they agree that the two-party system doesn’t necessarily give Americans the representation that they are promised, especially with left-wing insurgent Bernie Sanders fighting an uphill battle against the Democratic Party’s nomination system. “It is all but illegal to participate in US politics outside the twin titanic business parties. A majority of US citizens are disgusted with the status quo and want something new,” Mesplay told RT. “By nurturing real discussion and debate, RT America reveals an insistent international movement of polite dissent: the Green Party. Such visibility emboldens would-be voters who want a viable ‘third party’ in the United States.” Jill Stein, who was the Green Party’s nominee in 2012, said in a statement that that added that the Green Party debate is good news for Americans who are looking for something beyond the duopoly that the Democratic and Republican parties hold. “RT is breaking the two-party stranglehold on debates and beginning the open discussion the American people are clamoring for,” she said. “It’s a step towards real democracy and an inspiration for the millions of Americans who are ready for a new politics that puts people, planet and peace over profit.\" Stein’s sentiments are supported by the data: More and more Americans are identifying as independents, and more are voting based on their dislike of a party, according Steven Webster, a political science PhD candidate at Emory University. “We see sort of two contradictory things going on right now. One is that people are increasingly identifying as political independents, and another is that people are increasingly voting straight-ticket,” Webster told RT America. “The nature of partisan identification is changing. It used to be the case that we had positive attachments to parties. So, ‘I’m a democrat because I like their policy positions,’ or ‘my parents were both Democrats’. That’s not the case anymore. What we’re seeing is that people are motivated by their feelings of negativity towards the opposing party.” The Green Party, the fourth-largest party in the United States, offers a policy platform that is solidly left-wing across the board that might appeal to disenfranchised supporters of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, should he not secure the nomination. A\\xa0McClatchy-Marist poll released early last month showed that 25 percent of Sanders backers would not support Clinton in the general election, compared to 69 percent who would. Many Sanders supporters claim that their candidate is running in a system that is rigged by party elites, a sentiment that the underdog Green Party couldn’t share more. “Unfair ballot-access rules designed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers to block alternative-party candidates; election coverage by news media that perpetuates the myth that voters have only two choices; exclusion from forums and debates, including the two-candidate charade hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD),” the party said in a statement.

More than two-thirds of all Saudis in employment work for the government – compared to fewer than 20 percent for the US – and last year the kingdom spent about 45 percent of its budget, or $128 billion, to pay their wages. Prior to recent reforms, even a conscientious Saudi national civil servant had generous perks – a 35-hour working week, almost no prospect of being made redundant, and frequent bonuses, such as two monthly salaries paid to every bureaucrat, when King Salman ascended to the throne in early 2015. \"In my ministry we have more than a million job applicants. Of them, 200,000 are already working in the private sector and are prepared to take a pay cut,\" said Alaraj. With the economy expected to expand by only 1.2 percent this year, and oil prices hovering at around $50 per barrel, Saudi Arabia vast oil reserves, which still stand at over $500 billion, have been depleting at an alarming rate. \"If we didn\\'t take any reform measures, and if the global economy stays the same, then we\\'re doomed for bankruptcy in three to four years,\" said Mohamed Al Tuwaijri, the deputy economy minister, at the same meeting. The government has announced a raft of unprecedented steps to cut costs, some systematic, others haphazard. As well as introducing sales taxes for the first time, charging for pilgrimage visas at about $530 per entrant, dropping some energy subsides, and levying heavy new road fines, the government has been trying to slash costs in the public sector. Last month top officials had their salaries reduced by 20 percent, and their car and phone allowances sequestered, while ordinary workers lost 11 days’ pay when the government moved to the Gregorian calendar. Annual leave has been capped at 30 days. Underperforming civil servants can now be fired after three years, perhaps risible in most states, but a revolution in the kingdom, where many jobs are lifetime sinecures. In several departments throughout the Gulf kingdom, employees are now required to register their presence in the workplace several times a day, by swiping their ID cards. Yet King Salman is likely to proceed cautiously with any fundamental trims to the size of the public sector. For decades, the generous salaries paid by the state were seen as a form of redistribution of the oil wealth acquired by the country, which in turn paid for the loyalty of its subjects, who did not risk any calls for social or political reform. Throwing hundreds of thousands onto the streets is likely to endanger social stability, an outcome the House of Saud probably fears more than the depletion of currency reserves. To strike a compromise, officials have recently attempted to make the private sector more vibrant and attractive to employees, with reforms such as the end of the six-day working week, and reducing hours worked from 48 to 40 per week. In total, the government hopes that an extra 450,000 new jobs will be created in the private sector by 2020, boosting its size by a nearly one-third. ']\n",

Tension with Moscow is not the only thing bothering the military alliance. With a new US president soon to enter the White House, Western media is raising concerns over his plans for NATO. The European elites are growing increasingly worried about what any changes Trump may bring to the NATO alliance. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Stoltenberg urged NATO members to follow the British example and contribute two percent of GDP to the military alliance. Besides the UK, Poland, Estonia, Greece, and the United States are the only members of the 28-country alliance meeting the two percent threshold.

RT:\\xa0What do you make of Western media raising fears over Donald Trump’s plans for NATO? Jim Jatras: When the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact were out of business in 1991, NATO should have gone out of business as well. That didn’t happen. Unfortunately, NATO doesn’t have any particular function as a defensive organization - as we saw in Bosnia and Kosovo - it has behaved as an aggressive organization. It is an organization in search of a mission. Right now, we have Donald Trump who said that it is obsolete because it is not really defending its members’ territory against Islamic terrorism which is the only real threat Europe suffers. So frankly, what good is it? NATO is a product of the Cold War. It does not fit into our time anymore. My party and other parties; we can imagine a treaty which is for defense but not against Russia but more or less against another kind of threats, for example, terrorism…We should rearrange NATO and give NATO another structure and philosophy. In NATO there are still a lot of people in power who are attached to this old philosophy.-\\xa0Joachim Paul, from Alternative for Germany Party (AfD) RT:\\xa0Why are the European elites concerned about changes Trump may bring to the NATO alliance? JJ: It seems that there is still a very strong consensus for NATO in the American political establishment. Part of this is simply inertia that it is something that has been around forever. And let’s keep in mind: NATO is essentially a tool of Washington to maintain control over Europe in security affairs. Remember back in the 1990s, the EU indicated it wanted to develop its own defense capability, and that provoked near panic in Washington. The Washington establishment moved very quickly to quash any such independence from the Europeans and to insist that security affairs must be governed by NATO and only NATO as the premier security organization in Europe. The Europeans could help out if they wanted to, but they were not in control of the process.

Is that true? Is it defending Europe? JJ: Defend themselves from whom? One of the criticisms that Donald Trump has made of European countries and NATO is that they don’t spend the two percent threshold on defense which he considers rightly to be free-loading on the US. Why don’t they spend that much? These are wealthy countries. They can spend that money if they want to. Even Greece, which is not in a very good position, is actually one of the countries that does spend more than the threshold because they do perceive the threat, but from Turkey, a fellow NATO member. The reason these countries don’t spend the money is because they don’t feel threatened. For all the hype of a so-called Russian threat, with the absence of maybe Poland and the Baltic States, nobody in Europe feels threatened by Russia or any other external threat. The only real threat they face is the threat of terrorism. And NATO doesn’t seem to know what to do about that.

When the man, possessing a sheaf of blonde hair, was taken to the station and asked to provide ID, he said he had no documents, and that he was a gypsy by the name of Dmitry Mikhay. “Are you sure? Have you seen yourself in the mirror? Your complexion is way too light,” said the on-duty policeman, according to daily Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, whose journalist interviewed the officers dealing with the case. The detainee immediately confessed that it wasn’t his real name, and that he remembers only that he was called Vasily, when he was snatched by gypsies on his way home from an outdoor market where his mother was a trader. Police began to scan missing persons records. As well as a name, officers had another distinctive detail to work with – a large birthmark on Vasily’s chest. Soon, a likely candidate came up. Vasily Musofranov, a six-year old boy, “missing two bottom front teeth” and with a birthmark on his chest, who disappeared 16 years ago from the small town of Shakty, 350 km away. Musofranov’s case was opened as a murder investigation back in 2002, and remained unsolved. One look at the photograph was enough to convince police they were on the right path: the boy looked like a grown-up version of the child in a photograph that had been circulated in the media dozens of times in the past decade and a half. To obtain definitive evidence, the body of Musofanov’s father was exhumed, and a DNA sample taken, which produced a match. Within days a 48 year-old woman and a 46 year-old man from a nearby Romani settlement had been arrested. In a statement, police have said that the couple have “made a full admission of guilt.” According to the police, Vasily called his kidnappers “’mother’ and ‘father’, and his four new siblings ‘brother’ and sister.’” “I was scared at first, but then got used to it,” Vasily has told Komsomolskaya Pravda. Initially, his hair was dyed black to avoid suspicion, and he was never sent to school, meaning that he cannot read or write, or tell time. From the age of 16 he was forced to work to earn an income, which he gave to his “mother,” but last year he grew resentful, and decided to escape. From then on, he lived as a hobo, surviving by begging and doing odd jobs. Vasily has now been placed with a volunteer foster family, while his future is decided. But a happy ending is some way off. His closest surviving relative is aunt Elizaveta Bogomolova, who lives in Shakhty. She has said that his birth parents were problem drinkers, who were repeatedly fired from jobs, and were incapable of looking after their young son. His father, an Afghan war vet, died soon after the kidnapping, while the mother suffered a long decline, losing another child in infancy, before dying herself. Bogomolova says she is ready to help teach Vasily how to read and write, but is unsure if she can provide him with accommodation, as he prepares to return to life under his own name. His only other close relative is a half-sister, from his father’s first marriage, who emigrated to Finland even before Vasily disappeared. ']\n",

READ MORE: ‘Proxima b’ move-in ready?

The researchers have two theories based on maximum and minimum estimations for Proxima b’s radius. In the first instance, they say the planet is either very dense, like Mercury, and surface water would not make up more than 0.05 percent of the planet’s total mass. \\xa0 Or, in the bigger scenario, Proxima b would consist of 50 percent rocks and 50 percent water, and the planet would be completely covered by a single layer of ocean 200 kilometers deep. “In these extreme cases, a thin gas atmosphere could cover the planet, as on Earth, making Proxima b potentially habitable,” says CNRS. Proxima b gained international attention when years of research into the planet showed it may have the right conditions to support life, all of which was published in the Nature journal last August. Proxima b, which is 1.3 times the size of Earth, was found to be the planet most likely to harbor life - and as it’s located ‘just’ four light years away, it offers tantalizing possibilities as a site for human relocation. Either way, the new discoveries lay the groundwork for further exploration and future studies to determine (once and for all) the planet’s habitability.  \"]\n",

The story in the report was completely made up, Zakharova said, dismissing the report published on June 29, in which the Washington Post claimed that a “Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) guard stationed outside the US Embassy in Moscow attacked and beat up a US diplomat who was trying to enter the compound.” The ministry’s spokeswoman explained that, in reality, it was a US citizen who attacked a Russian security guard stationed outside the US embassy when the officer tried to check his ID. “On the night of June 6, a taxi drove up to the US embassy in Moscow. A man with a hat drawn over his eyes jumped out of the car and rushed to the entrance. A police officer, who was on duty at the entrance, tried to check the ID of the suspicious man to ensure that there is no threat for the embassy,” Zakharova told journalists at a briefing on Thursday. “Instead of letting the officer see his ID, the man hit him with an elbow in the face than pushed him away and fled to the embassy,” she added, stressing that the Washington Post report “not only distorts the information but openly contradicts the facts.” She also emphasized that the attack on the police officer was recorded by the CCTV cameras and presented to the US State Department “long ago,” with Russian Foreign Ministry filing a protest over the incident. It was later revealed that the man who attacked the officer was in fact a CIA agent, who worked in Russia under diplomatic cover and was returning from a mission on the night of the attack, the spokeswoman stressed, adding that the agent apparently tried to escape recognition. She also said that information about the ‘diplomat’s’ allegedly broken shoulder reported by the Washington Post report is also false and was disproved by a video presented by the US side to the Russian ministry. Zakharova also emphasized that it is the US that asked Russia to provide security for its embassy and send police to guard it. “Moreover, they [the US] regularly ask us to enhance [the embassy’s] security,” she added. The ministry’s spokeswoman also expressed “regret” over “Washington deliberately souring the bilateral relations particularly by provocations and disinformation,” stressing that such policy “will not lead to anything good.” The Washington Post report came just a day after Russian Foreign Ministry slammed another article by the US newspaper that claimed that “Russia is harassing US diplomats all over Europe.” It’s the Russian diplomats who are being pressured, not the other way around, the Foreign Ministry said, blasting the article.

Two of them were acquitted, 15 were given prison sentences ranging from six months to 25 years, and 15 others were sentenced to death. Most of the convicts served in the military and diplomatic spheres. They also worked in economic, financial and academic fields. The men are accused of collaborating with agents from Iranian intelligence and leaking information on the Saudi armed forces and national security to Tehran. They also attempted to recruit people “working in state agencies to commit acts of espionage for the Iranian intelligence service.” Others hacked into computers to obtain the data concerning internal and external security of Saudi Arabia. Some of the suspects even allegedly met Iran’s Supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The majority of the convicts were members of the Shiite minority, a source close to the case told AFP.Some were also accused of supporting demonstrations in the Shiite-dominated Qatif governorate in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. According to Human Rights Watch’s (HRW) Middle East researcher Adam Coogle, the trial was “flawed from the beginning.” He told AFP that the alleged spies’ offences don’t look like recognizable crimes, including “supporting demonstrations,” trying to “spread the Shia confession,” and “harming the reputation of the kingdom.”“Criminal trials should not be merely legal ‘window-dressing’ where the verdict has been decided beforehand,” he said.

In October this year, an AFP tally showed that the kingdom had executed at least 134 people.

Nimr was among 47 people either beheaded or shot by firing squad across Saudi Arabia in one day – the largest number of individuals executed in a single day since 1980. The execution prompted waves of protests in Iran. Angry demonstrators broke into the Saudi embassy in Tehran, ravaging its offices and throwing Molotov cocktails at the building.

We will venture out. pic.twitter.com/GZmnJgzSXW The system apparently defies Newton’s third law, which holds that everything must have an equal and opposite reaction. Generating thrust momentum in one direction requires something to be expelled, such as a propellant or exhaust, but the EM Drive doesn’t do this. The paper doesn’t explain how this is possible, but suggests the “supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorized as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.” The team behind the paper were testing to see if the drive actually works, rather than striving to attain the greatest performance, meaning that the system can likely be made even more efficient.

The paper notes that more research is needed to determine exactly how EmDrive actually works, and whether it is really producing thrust, as it’s possible that thermal expansion may be affecting the results. The EmDrive is scheduled to be tested in space in the next few months. Should it work there, skeptics in the science community will have to figure out how the drive generates thrust without exhaust.

A declaration outlining the joint position of the BRICS group on the Syrian crisis is expected to be signed during the summit. China has repeatedly backed Russia’s position on the situation in Syria, while India has previously expressed major interest in achieving stability in the Middle East. “China and Russia hold similar positions on the most important international and regional issues, including on Syria and Afghanistan,” China’s vice foreign minister Li Baodong said this week. “The sides, being permanent members of the UN Security Council, continue close cooperation on international and regional issues.” However Brazil, unlike China and India, may choose to take a neutral stance on the Syrian crisis, political scientist Aleksander Shatilov believes. “The West managed to rock BRICS with the coup in Brazil,” Shatilov told RT. “As a result, Brazil will have a neutral opinion on many problems. The BRICS approach to solving international conflicts could be among them.” The integration of the Eurasian Economic Union (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) in the so-called Silk Road Economic Belt project is among one of the main goals of the summit. While infrastructure projects of the New Silk Road are already underway in EEU states, experts note both the importance of such an ambitious project, as well as certain possible obstacles that could stand in its way. The summit may also mark a further expansion of EEU to the east, according to the Director of Eurasian Economic Union Institute Vladimir Lepehin. “Today EEU, tomorrow EEU and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a day after tomorrow – other countries of Eurasian economical area, which are not members of EEU and SCO,” said Lepehin. The creation of BRICS raised hopes that the end of the unipolar world is near, but this “dream” is still unfulfilled and the new summit is an important step for reaching that goal, believes political scientist Daniel Shaw from the City University of New York. “The dream of the BRICS nations and really of all oppressed countries in the world is still unrealized,” Shaw told RT. “Eighth years ago Russia, China, South Africa, India and Brazil came together to form the BRICS block as a counterweight to US hegemony, to unipolar world where the US dominated military and geopolitically as well as economically. Eight years later that’s an unfinished dream and an unfinished mission, hence why this meeting, this summit this weekend in India is all the more important.” The previous BRICS summit took place in the southern Ural city of Ufa, Russia, in July 2015. BRICS countries then established the New Development Bank (NDB), which has the potential to become an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ']\n",

In an attempt to remedy the situation, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayor Kadir Topbas said that he has ordered the allocation of space for the final resting place for “traitors” where “the passersby will curse the ones buried there.” “I ordered a space to be saved and [for it to be called] ... ‘the graveyard for traitors',” Topbas told a group of pro-government protesters in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. “Everyone visiting the place will curse them and they won’t be able to rest in their graves.” The decision to provide space, Topbas said, came after the mayor of Ordu, a port city on the Black Sea coast did not provide burial plots. As a result, the family of one of the dead took a body and buried it in their garden. “I congratulate the mayor,” Topbas said as quoted by Anadolu Agency, adding that coup plotters “won’t be saved from hell.” The mayor of Istanbul, a city of some 15 million people, also said that even the cemetery of the nameless was not a suitable place for the coup plotters to be buried with religious people. “I believe that they won’t be saved from hell.

The failed putsch left 246 people dead and another 1,500 others injured. In the wake of the coup, the government has started a witch-hunt against the organizers, as it blamed the Gulen-linked groups for masterminding the failed coup attempt. Turkey also requested that Washington extradite self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s president and his government of orchestrating the coup. On Wednesday, following a National Security Council meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a three month state of emergency and confirmed that the “cleansing” operation in the country would continue until all attempted coup plotters and supporters have been punished. Earlier, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that 7,543 people, including 100 police officers, 6,038 soldiers, 755 judges and prosecutors, and 650 civilians, have been detained so far. Since the coup, Erdogan has been pushing for the introduction of the death penalty in the country that was suspended over a decade ago. “The people on the streets have made that request,” Erdogan told CNN on Sunday. “The people have the opinion that these terrorists should be killed ... why should I keep them and feed them in prisons for years to come, that's what the people say.” Such move has been criticized by the European Union, which Turkey is trying to join. “Let me be very clear... no country can become an EU state if it introduces the death penalty,” EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said earlier. While Erdogan maintains that any decision to reinstate capital punishment would need to be initiated by the parliament, he has confirmed he would approve the legislature if one was proposed. \"]\n",

Then a late swing in the postal ballots gave victory to his rival, independent Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. Before the final results were counted, RT asked experts what a Hofer win could have meant for Austria and the EU. If Hofer won, it wouldn’t have an immediate political impact in Austria, because the president doesn’t really have political influence on day-to-day politics, says Dr. Heinz Gaertner from the Austrian Institute for International Affairs in Vienna. “There would not be an immediate political impact on the European level either. But it might change the atmosphere in Austria and also in Europe,” he told RT. He said the country is currently split into two camps: “the right-wing supporters of Hofer and liberal-democrats and liberal-conservatives who have a very different policy in mind.” Alexander Markovics, from the right-wing \"Generation Identity\" movement in Austria, argued that a Hofer’s victory would be very decisive for the Freedom Party. “It would be finally a possibility for the Freedom Party to redefine the position of the Austrian president which is actually very powerful, but its power was not used in the past,” he said. \\xa0 According to Heinz Gaertner, “the constitution gives the president a right to dissolve parliament and dismiss the government. But no president so far has used this right.” However, he does not think “a future president – even Hofer – would use it, or I would say, abuse it that way.” For the first time since the Second World War, the two main centrist parties were knocked out in the election\\'s first round. About half the voters support far-right views. \\xa0 “Many are just not satisfied with the coalition government we have had for many years; they just want to have a change,” Gaertner said, commenting on what could have caused voters to support Hofer. In his view though, it’s not really a right-wing shift what’s happening in Austria, but rather a divide - particularly on such issues as migrants and refugees.\\xa0 \\xa0 According to Alexander Markovics, the polarization within the Austrian society “is huge” and it has caused a shift of public opinion. “We have the socialists and conservatives who made the immigrant invasion in summer 2015 possible and who also let the security situation totally get out of hand. And now in Vienna we have ‘no-go’ areas where Austrians cannot go any longer, we have huge ethnic tensions because of the mass migration which escalated last year,” he said. “A lot of people are disoriented and totally disappointed with the political system in Austria because they don’t feel represented any longer since they could not participate in these decisions.” Friedrich Schneider, Economics Professor at the University of Linz, agrees the shift to the right was caused by the refugee crisis. Other causes, he believes, are “the euro crisis” and the “dissatisfaction with the European Union.” These three components, he said, “create a great uncertainty for a lot of Austrians.” “The future doesn’t look so positive anymore – we have rising unemployment. All this helps conservative parties which seem to have simple solutions to get votes…it is now up to the government to steer against this, to make policies which are credible and to take this vote into consideration for the next policy steps. …It is a clear signal for Austria that current politics have to make drastic changes,” Schneider said. Hofer’s age – he is only 45 years old, while his rival Alexander Van der Bellen is 72 – could have also given him additional points among the voters,\\xa0 said Arnold Kammel, director of the Austrian Institute for European Policy and Security in Vienna. “I think Mr. Hofer, being the younger candidate, had somewhat the advantage of giving the population a feeling that their concerns are taken seriously,” he told RT.

The dignitaries arriving as part of the Syrian delegation include Muslim and Christian clerics, such as His Beatitude Gregory III Laham, Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, the spiritual leader of the world’s Melkite Greek Catholic Chruch; His Holiness Ignatius Aphrem II of Antioch, world’s spiritual leader of the Syriac Orthodox Church; and they include His Grace Dr Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria. Meanwhile, secular voices among the delegation include Dr Ahmad al-Khaddour and Dr Bashir Mohammad. The former is a cardiothoracic surgeon and Professor of Medicine at Damascus University, while the latter is a cardiologist and native of Hama. Both are intent on raising the egregious role of EU sanctions in reducing conditions within Syrian hospitals to such a parlous state that women and children are dying every day due to the absence of basic medicines and drugs. In order to emphasize the authority that this delegation speaks on events in Syria, it is worth noting that each has witnessed, suffered, and/or lost family members and loved ones to a conflict which, strip away the obfuscation and claims to the contrary, involves an Islamic Khmer Rouge attempting to implement its very own Year Zero on a multi-religious, multicultural, and multi-tribal society. The man responsible for organizing this event and bringing together such an impressive delegation to visit Ireland is Dr. Declan Hayes, a tireless activist in support of human rights in Syria and a champion of its religious minorities. Declan, whose work can be found at the We Save Syria\\xa0website, has made numerous visits to the country over the course of the conflict, offering aid and solidarity to its embattled people and raising awareness of their plight back in Ireland and the UK. As a consequence there is no one who speaks with more authority on the reality of the conflict and the crisis that has engulfed the country than he does. “Though the visit is timed to coincide with the run up to Christmas and all that entails,” he said, “the situation in Syria, as East Aleppo's human shields show, remains very grave for all Syrians, from the youngest to the oldest. Although this visit is non-political it must be clearly stated that EU sanctions, in which Ireland are fully complicit, are killing more Syrian children than even ISIS.” He went on, “The USA, for all its Russophobia, has yet to deliver one bread roll or bandage to Aleppo, whereas the Russian Air Force continues to fly in tons of much needed food, clothing and medicines. Although Ireland cannot hope to match Russia's humanitarian contribution, we do have the chance and the duty to be a lodestar for peace and reconciliation in Western Europe by setting an example on Syria that other independent-minded peoples can emulate.” The Western narrative of the conflict in Syria would have us believe that something approximating to a revolution has been taking place in the country, one that enjoys popular support from ordinary Syrians. It is a narrative so grotesque, so Goebbelsian in its distortion of the truth, that it confirms the abiding mendacity of those who purport to champion democracy and human rights even as they set the world on fire. In truth the Assad government enjoys the support\\xa0of the overwhelming majority of Syrians, people who understand the difference between reform and ruin, and who refuse to stand by and allow their country to be destroyed by religious fanatics and butchers, supported by those friends of liberty the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments. Each of the aforementioned is of course a strong regional ally of Washington and its European partners, evidence that what passes for democracy in the West is in point of fact nothing more than organized hypocrisy. It is in defiance of this hypocrisy that this Syrian delegation arrives in Ireland to spread the word and raise awareness of what is really taking place in their country. In so doing no one should be in any doubt that they speak for a nation and society that only by dint of uncommon tenacity and fidelity to truth has managed to survive an onslaught that has been waged against it by the forces of hell.

They also declared that this is “a warning to other businesses,” which will also be “targeted.” “We’ve got a feeling Byrons [sic] will be closed for a few days on account of fumigation... This is just the beginning. Strike them were it hurts,” wrote the London Black Revolutionaries on their Facebook page, addressing their 11,000 followers. The Malcolm X Movement said that the stunt had wider significance “in the context of growing racist and even fascist oriented policies encouraging and fostering mass resentiment, [sic] racism and xenophobia towards ethnic and migrant communities.” In an operation that took place on July 4, but was not made public until this week, about 35 employees were called into a meeting, ostensibly to teach them a new method for cooking beef patties, according to eyewitness testimonies in the UK media. However, when staff arrived, the kitchen and floor workers, who were from Albania, Brazil, Nepal, and other non-EU states, were rounded up. Some of them have since been deported. Unconfirmed media reports claim that as many as 150 other employees went into hiding following the sting. UK authorities said the chain, which would have faced fines of up to £20,000 per employee for knowingly employing migrants without a legal permit, had been shown “counterfeit documents” when hiring them. Byron said it “co-operated fully and acted upon the Home Office’s requests throughout the course of the investigations leading to this action.” Despite being in compliance with existing UK immigration laws, the operation drew fury from a segment of social media and, by Friday, several of Byron’s London and Bristol outlets were being picketed by small groups of activists before the insect-releasing stunt was launched. The decision to use direct action to sabotage restaurant outlets has received mixed public reaction, with many pointing out it would be the staff that would have to round up the insects and lose income if a branch was forcibly shut for several days.

Clinton aims at recruiting five million Americans between the ages of 18 and 30 to help local, state and federal governments cope with a range of problems, “from natural disasters in places like Baton Rouge or emergency relief in places like Flint, MI to addressing the epidemic of addiction in places like New Hampshire.” “The Reserve will provide a vehicle for the sense of civic ownership and responsibility that Clinton has felt throughout her life, bringing Americans from all backgrounds together in common cause to make a difference where they live,” the campaign said. In exchange for serving, the reservists would be eligible for college credit, time off from work, or even a “modest stipend” based on financial need, the announcement explained.

Millennials are eager to volunteer and serve, the campaign argued, citing as example that the number of applications to AmeriCorps is five times greater than the number of openings in the paid service organization. The former secretary of state also said she wanted to triple the size of AmeriCorps from 75,000 to 250,000 members and expand the Peace Corps. The expansion would also create new volunteer opportunities for Americans over 55, the campaign said. The Peace Corps was established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, as a way for Americans to “promote world peace and friendship” abroad. Its domestic version, AmeriCorps, was set up by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Though Clinton’s campaign floated plans to expand AmeriCorps in August of last year, the Democratic candidate is currently amid a major push to appeal to young voters.

Unfortunately, the decline in relations between Russia and the European Union stands in the way of further strengthening our cooperation, with an adverse effect on the dynamics of bilateral trade that fell by a third to $2.75 billion as compared to last year. Particularly affected were Greek agricultural producers,” Putin said. In 2015 trade between the two countries fell by 33.7 percent to about $2.8 billion. Ninety percent of that loss was exports from Russia to Greece. Russian imports from Greece decreased by 54 percent and amounted to $229.4 million.

Seddique Mateen, farther of the Orlando nightclub shooter who claimed the lives of 49 people, was spotted on Monday sitting behind Hillary Clinton during a rally in Kissimmee, Florida.\\xa0 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reacted, arguing that there are double standards, because if it had been him standing in front of the mass murderer’s father, there would have been “a headline all over the world about Trump.”\\xa0 “But she did not, as I understand it, disavow this man. [Mateen]’s got some pretty harsh views,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. RT asked Rockwell and Welch if Mateen should have been invited to the rally and if his presence there could somehow affect Clinton’s campaign?\\xa0 RT: What’s your take on that?\\xa0 Lew Rockwell: First of all it is hilarious. Despite the Clinton’s campaign’s claim that this was just open to the public – nobody gets that close to a candidate through secret service and so forth, unless they are known. The people especially behind the candidate are always very carefully chosen for “diversity reasons,” etc. He said he was invited. Of course he was invited. This was a signal on the part of the Clinton campaign to the immigrant masses that they should all support her. But it quite wonderfully backfired. Some of us think if this guy hadn’t been brought to the US by the US government, and apparently he was, because of his Afghan connections, political connections; his hate for Pakistan, and so forth, all those people in Orlando would still be alive. The idea that this guy is… there is some kind of icon of the Clinton campaign. Well, it is really all you need to know about the Clinton campaign. \\xa0\\xa0 RT:\\xa0What kind of effect do you think it will have on Clinton’s campaign?\\xa0 LR: Who knows. If Trump is smart, and he is smart, he’ll make a big deal of it. But it is just a part of the rest of it. We learned today that Julian Assange is offering a $20,000 reward to investigate the death of this DNC murdered staffer. The implication being, and sort of a lot of people think he was the one who leaked the DNC e-mails. Was he killed for that? There is all kinds of bad stuff.\\xa0 I know the typical Americans seem to think that this sort of conduct only goes on in Montenegro, or whatever. It happens here too. The Clintons have got a long list of bodies in their wake. So the fact that they would promote this guy – Mr. Mateen – hold him up as a symbol to people that are interested in these sorts of links, blew up in their face. My guess is this was not Clinton’s personal decision. Although, you can’t really know – she is very, very much a detailed person, so we can’t rule that out. But somebody high in the campaign invited him in, brought him there, put him in that very prominent position, where he was in the frame of her during her speech – quite an amazing thing and sort of as a peek into the heart, if I can use that word of Hillary Clinton.\\xa0 RT: How do you think the media would have reacted if this had happened at a Trump rally?\\xa0 LR: I’ve never in my life seen media hate even for Barry Goldwater back in ancient days as for Trump. It is like the Two Minutes Hate out of George Orwell’s 1984 goes on every single day over and over again by the world media. It is the English media, for example, the Canadian media – all English language media, and probably foreign language media too hate Trump, hate Trump, hate Trump! There are many death threats against Trump – they never cover it.\\xa0 Facebook has fan pages advocating this assassination of Trump. It is not even an issue; nobody cares or they approve of it. Everything that Trump says, or allegedly says, of course, becomes an atomic bomb. On the other hand, there are a lot of people who think anybody this much hated by the media, this much hated by the establishment, can’t be all bad.\\xa0 Daniel Patrick Welch, a writer and political analyst, argues that Mateen’s invite to the event was just a PR gaffe.\\xa0 “It is a gaffe – nobody wants this kind of publicity,” he told RT. “He was invited along with three million of his closest friends. It is true. They could have, and should have, vetted this more clearly and they could have avoided a public relations gaffe. It is really a cover story for the failure of the American political system.”\\xa0 In Welch’s view, the whole thing “is a tempest in a teapot, or a red herring on a slow news day to take away from, or give the impression, that this is an actual vibrant democracy going on in the US, when nothing could be further from the truth.”\\xa0 “There is this political theatre, this joke, farce of a campaign. We have no choice at all – we have a choice between the neoliberal, neoconservative consensus and this right-wing populist, opportunist with open overture to fascism. And you expect people to make an informed choice between those alternatives,” he said.\\xa0 The analyst is confident that this ‘gaffe’ will have ‘zero’ impact on Clinton’s campaign.\\xa0\\xa0 “Everything that comes out that is negative about Clinton gets completely disappeared by the mainstream press. Trump will do something equally outrageous within the next 24 hour news cycle. So the attention will be drawn away from it – I don’t think it has any legs at all,” he said.

People all over the world look to us and follow our lead.” “The decisions we make and the actions we take – even the actions we don’t take – affect millions, even billions of lives,” Clinton said. When America fails to lead, that either leads to chaos, or leaves a vacuum that other countries rush in to fill, she added. Clinton described the US as an “exceptional nation,” bringing up Abraham Lincoln’s description of “the last best hope of Earth” and Ronald Reagan’s line about “a shining city on a hill.” This belief in American exceptionalism should be above politics, Clinton told the American Legion, bringing up the recent letter by 50 Bush Administration officials criticizing the GOP nominee Donald Trump as reckless and dangerous. “They know I believe in a bipartisan foreign policy,” Clinton said, adding she was honored by their support. Hillary Clinton is giving a foreign policy speech right now that sounds like it was written by Genghis Khan. Reflecting this, the speech contained mixed messages about the US military, with Clinton proclaiming that the US “must always send troops in as a last resort, not a first choice… But we must be able to act decisively, alone if we need to.” The former is a strongly held belief of the Obama administration, the latter a key point of the George W. Bush presidency. Another example was Clinton’s condemnation of the cap on government spending that went into effect in 2013. Prominent Republican Senator John McCain has led the calls for getting rid of the sequestration and beefing up the military budget. \"The sequester makes our country less secure. Let’s end it,” Clinton told the Legion, adding that this would allow the Pentagon to invest in\\xa0new technologies that “can transform our military.” Clinton also argued the US must take the lead in outer space and cyberspace, citing\\xa0recent reports in US media accusing Russia and China of breaching a number of US private and government computer systems, including the Democratic National Committee and several state election boards. None of those claims have been substantiated by any evidence. Still, Clinton argued that the US should treat cyber-attacks like any other act of aggression, and respond accordingly. Hillary’s speech about American exceptionalism is now about mental health care for veterans. She then pivoted to the issue of veterans and their medical care, promising not to let anyone privatize the Veterans Administration and vowing to “build a 21st century VA that delivers world-class care” instead. This would improve care for overlooked female veterans, but also “identify and treat all wounds of war, visible and invisible, including Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome” and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as improve mental health services to “end the epidemic of veteran suicides.” Trump is expected to address Clinton’s criticism during his scheduled appearance at the Legion convention on Thursday.

The conviction brought about 300 peaceful protesters out on the streets of Burns, a one-light town in northern Oregon (pop. 2,806), to voice their concern that the federal government should not be involving itself in matters the protesters say is a strictly local affair. The organizers of the\\xa0siege are brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, whose father, Cliven, grabbed headlines last year following a\\xa0tense standoff in Nevada against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over cattle grazing rights. The group has issued two demands that the government will be very hard-pressed to meet: to release the Hammonds and surrender control of the Malheur National Forest. “We’re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that’s been set upon them,” Ammon Bundy, the self-declared leader of the group, said in a Facebook video posted by Sarah Dee Spurlock on Saturday. A statement released by David Ward, sheriff of Harney County,\\xa0said the militants want to \"overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\" So is it true? Has the mainstream media gone soft on the Bundy gang, who are now holed up inside an isolated government-owned building, because they do not fit the popular stereotypical image of the traditional \"terrorist\" (Hint: has a dark complexion, does not profess the Christian faith, traditionally wears a heavy beard and seldom travels without foreign documents and explosives). Is America unwilling to come to grip with the fact that there is such a thing as a \"homegrown terrorist\"? ABC helped to fuel the\\xa0suspicion that the media was deliberately downplaying the situation when it released this anticlimactic update via Twitter: “Peaceful protest followed by Oregon wildlife refuge action.” And that was it. The reader could be forgiven for thinking they may have missed a Woodstock-style love-in on some private farmland. As predictably as thunder follows lightning, the tweet attracted a slew of sarcastic, snarky comments from Americans who were convinced this was an act of domestic terrorism, including this gem by Theresa Rose, who posted: “Here let me help you, ‘Armed white terrorist takeover (sic) take over wildlife refuge... you\\'re welcome.” @ABC Here let me help you, \"Armed white terrorist take over wildlife refuge\"... you\\'re welcome. Twitter user Willy Wonky fired off: \"That\\'s the most sugar coated headline I\\'ve ever seen... stop giving us white people headlines like that.\" Meanwhile, Donald G. Carder opined: \"There\\'s nothing ‘peaceful’ about a group of armed rednecks seizing public property. This is terrorism, plain and simple.\" @ABC that\\'s the most sugar coated headline I\\'ve ever seen...stop giving us white people headlines like that Finally, @AngryBlack Lady dismissed all decorum and discretion, asking: \"Are you f*cking serious with this headline?! RT @ABC: Peaceful protest followed by Oregon wildlife refuge action.\" And this leads us to the $64-million question: Should we categorize every act of public protest – even by some redneck \"armed militants\" – as an act of terrorism? The American Heritage Dictionary defines a terrorist as somebody who stages \"unexpected attacks on civilian targets, including embassies and airliners, with the aim of sowing fear and confusion.\" So are the Bundy brothers, whose only crime (so far) has been to seize a government office in the middle of nowhere, now bona-fide terrorists in the same major leagues as al-Qaeda and Islamic State? This is where we risk getting stuck in a swamp of semantics in an effort to establish exactly how to call such individuals. After all, just imagine if these white Christian \"militia members\" – apparently willing to wage a war with the government – had been a group of Muslims protesting the treatment of detainees in the Guantanamo Bay facility, for example. It is a safe bet to say the newspaper headlines would be screaming in bold-font print the world \"terrorist\" and perhaps even \"Islamic State\" from coast-to-coast. On the other hand, if we accept the idea that such acts of protest on the part of the people – which Henry David Thoreau elegantly defined as \"civil disobedience\" – are now acts of terrorism, then we must also accept the disturbing fact that the very founding of the United States, bloody and violent as it was, was based on \"acts of terrorism,\" thus making the entire American experiment in democratic rule null and void. #OregonUnderAttack:People slam lack of govt action after Bundy’s militia takeover in Oregon https://t.co/SMJB7K1hXMpic.twitter.com/BmbB1RAkqT Consider the Boston Tea Party of 1773, where a group of American colonists, fed up with paying taxes to the British crown, dumped a large shipment of tea into Boston harbor. This single act of protest, in which not a single person was killed or injured, set the stage for what came to be known as the American War of Independence and the Declaration of Independence. For better or worse, there would have been no US of A had those rebels at Boston not ruined the Queen\\'s tea shipment. Is there a single history book that labels these American colonists who went on to found the United States \"terrorists\"? Certainly not, at least not the history books stored in US libraries. Indeed, they are held up with great esteem as founding fathers of the country. This is not an attempt to justify the actions of the Bundy brothers, who have certainly committed a crime by their outrageous seizure of government-owned property (which, as a federal offense, could possibly carry a hefty jail term and fine). However, it is extremely important, I believe, to differentiate between full-blown acts of terrorism – where things go boom and scores of innocent people die – and acts of protest against a perceived injustice. Understanding this difference is crucial at a time when many Americans, instinctively suspicious of their political servants since the founding of the great nation, believe the US government has seized too many powers for itself under the very threat of \"terrorism.\" One need only consider the controversial passage of the so-called US Patriot Act (which few if any legislators had the luxury of reading), which places tremendous restraints on American freedoms and liberties. But I digress. The point is, we must be careful not to categorize every pubic dissenter as a cold-blooded \"terrorist,\" which not only does a great disservice to the English language; it instills the dangerous idea in the public mind that every act of protest is the equivalent to an act of terrorism, which is certainly not true. At the same time, for the US mainstream media to sugarcoat the actions of the Bundy brothers and their supporters as part of some \"peaceful protest\" is equally ludicrous, and especially more so considering how a group of Muslims would be treated under similar circumstances. The word that comes to mind is “hypocrisy,” which is perhaps the ugliest thing to witness in the media, considering that journalists like to imagine they provide a fair and balanced account of all events, regardless of the background of the actors. And as is so often the case in such instances, the truth regarding this dangerous standoff with the US government and how to label the Bundy brothers lies somewhere in the middle, and it is our duty – lest every act of protest by an American citizen be either downplayed as “trivial” or overblown as “terrorism” – to define our terms as appropriately and accordingly as possible. @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

For Russia, the project is important because it will bypass the territory of Ukraine as a transit country, which has repeatedly proven itself as unreliable partner,” said economist Anna Glazova in an interview with Izvestia daily.

On Monday, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is set to release a report regarding allegations of state-sponsored doping among Russian athletes during the Sochi Olympics in 2014. The exact content of the report, prepared by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, is not known. However, the leaked letter, which was reportedly signed by United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart and Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports (CCES) CEO Paul Melia, calls on the president of the International Olympic Committee to “instigate a ban” on the entire Russian Olympics team from the Rio Games. ”Both the independence and the confidentiality of the report have been compromised,” said Hickey, stressing that McLaren’s report should have been kept secret until its official release.

However, the RT crew still managed to film some flags flying above their positions. YPG are unequivocal about Turkey’s sponsorship of terrorist groups in Syria. Head of the YPG in Afrin, Abdu Ibrahim, says Turkey is definitely providing support for terrorist groups in the area. “Turkey wanted to make a coalition against terrorism, but any country which would be in a coalition against terrorism should not open its border to Al-Nusra Front,” he said. “When there is a Kurdish prisoner, when he is in Turkish hands, they deliver him to Al-Nusra Front, whereas a wounded man from Islamic State who is in a Turkish hospital: he gets immunity and guards. No one can even look at him. What more evidence do you want than that?” Abdu Ibrahim also said that some of the corpses that they found on the battlefield \"that belong to Al-Nusra Front were of Turkish origin and we even found IDs and passports. And the ammo we found in their warehouses - closed boxes of ammo - they were closed and stamped by the Turkish government. We even found clearance documents to allow [the boxes of ammo] cross the borders which proved that they were approved to cross the borders.\" Ankara says its direct strikes against the YPG are justified due to its links with the Turkish-based militant group the PKK, which Turkey has recently resumed its war against at home. The rebel fighters on the ground say they are certain Turkey is providing assistance to IS, Al-Qaeda and Al Nusra. “The reason Turkey is on the ground is to support groups like Al-Qaeda. Support for ISIS is coming from Turkey. They are shelling because it wants to occupy our land, not to help our people. Turkey dismissed many of the armed groups, and supported Al Nusra against us,”\\xa0Abu Jouma Benawii, a general in the FSA and co-founder of Jaish al-Thuwar (Army of Revolutionaries), told RT. “Our fronts against the regime have stopped, but our fronts against ISIS are going on and against Al Nusra as well. We are committed to the ceasefire, one million percent,” he added. Asked if he would have changed his mind about joining the uprising, Abu Jouma Benawii said in hindsight: \"Really I would have changed my mind, because everybody contributed to destroying Syria, at the beginning and the end it is only the people who lose.\" “Had we known that Syria’s friends would be like this, we wouldn’t have been with them. All our people were forced to flee,\" he added. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said Turkey has the right to carry out military operations not only in Syria, but in any other country hosting terror groups that threaten the Turkish state.

The ceasefire in Syria, which came into force on February 27, brokered by leading world powers, including the US and Russia, is designed to pave the way to reconciliation between the Syrian government and moderate rebel forces. They would together agree on a peaceful transition in the country. Some of the forces in Syria, including IS and Al-Nusra, are not subject to the ceasefire. Experts have been criticizing moderate rebel forces, but even they think that the situation is shifting now. Moderate rebels used to be “a fable, a pure lie,” Syrian political analyst Taleb Ibrahim told RT. “Everyone remembers what happened to the rebels who had been trained in Turkish camps by the CIA, and when they returned to Syria, and turned to Al-Nusra Front”. However, the situation is starting to change slowly, as more and more Syrian rebel fighters “discover that they are destroying their country and serving external plans to divide Syria.” Russian aircraft continue to carry out airstrikes against Al-Nusra front militants to “stabilize the situation” in the regions north of the city of Aleppo, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

He only acquired 1 percent of the popular vote, but that’s considered a big achievement for third-party candidates in the United States’ two-party system. In 2016, he is confident that he can shake up the Democrat-Republican dichotomy even further by offering ideas that distinguish him from both parties. “I am a classical liberal, which is being fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” he told RT. “The notion of, in this case, government spending, the government is too big, let’s get it under control, let’s balance the federal budget or there will be horrible consequences. And then personal liberty and freedom and the responsibility that goes along with that. So absolutely staunch supporters of civil liberties.” Johnson took both major parties to task for what he sees as a failure to offer pragmatic solutions to the American people. He criticized Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton for following in President Barack Obama’s footsteps by supporting government spending that will cause the national debt to reach $20 trillion by the time the next president takes office. “One, it looks like [Donald] Trump is going to be the [Republican] nominee, the other, it looks like it’s going to be Hillary,” he said. “Well is anything going to change under Hillary? And has Hillary not promised everything to everybody?” Johnson supports a balanced budget to decrease government spending, and suggested that, if elected president, he will do so through veto power. “As president of the United States I can veto spending, something I did as the governor of New Mexico, and that has a positive impact.” Though he was a Republican when he served as governor of New Mexico, he blasted Trump, the Republican frontrunner, for the celebrity businessman’s firm stance against immigration. “The first thing he’s going to do is deport 11 million illegal immigrants?” Johnson said. “That is absolutely ridiculous and building a fence across the border is too.” This kind of rhetoric, he said, will result in a large amount of “disenfranchised Republicans” and voters in general who will be looking for an alternative. While Johnson claims that he is not “delusional” about his chances of actually being sworn in as the commander-in-chief, the former governor is confident that he can help shift the conversation. “I could be providing that alternative, and I could bump up to a level in the polls where all of a sudden the libertarian view has to be addressed on every single issue of the day.” Businessmen like Trump and doctors like Ben Carson leading career politicians in the polls “is an indication of just how frustrated people are,” Johnson claimed. “Eighty percent of Americans want more than two choices, and yet they have no idea why there isn’t another choice.” One of the major stumbling blocks, though, is the unfair treatment of third parties by the Presidential Debate Commission, whom the Libertarian Party is suing after being barred access to presidential debates. “The Presidential Debate Commission, I think, is at the heart of why there aren’t any more choices. I think that the Democrats and Republicans collude with one another just another to just debate one another and I think the networks may play a role in that also,” Johnson said, noting that a Libertarian being included in the presidential debates would be a “game changer.” The Libertarian Party convention to nominate their presidential candidate is set for Memorial Day, and Johnson faces off against 25 others registered on the party’s ballot. “I think that I offer a pretty compelling argument to be the next Libertarian nominee,” he said. “But look, it’s a process and I respect the process, and I’m gonna engage it. And I hope everybody in the process has a fair shake. That’s the argument I’m making to the American people. A Libertarian candidate should have a fair shake in the general election.” ']\n",
            "['9 Nov, 2016 16:23 ', 'Trump shock victory: New Cold War no more?', 'op-edge', 'So, the unthinkable has happened. Donald Trump has won. And the so-called liberal world order, which has ruled almost unchallenged since the demise of the Soviet Union is probably toast. There’s been enough talk already about the repercussions for America itself. So, here we will stick to external affairs. But there’s one important domestic proposal which greatly affects America’s global position. In his victory speech, Trump made a major point of emphasizing his desire to invest heavily in America’s decaying infrastructure. And there’s only one feasible way to fund such a plan - sharply cut military spending and foreign aid.Thus, instead of flinging billions of American tax dollars around the Middle East, Asia and Europe, in what always amounted to bribing nations - or at least their elites - into friendship, Trump intends to bring a good deal of the money home. By any measure, this will amount to a geopolitical earthquake. Take Syria, for instance, where Washington has plowed huge resources into promoting a “regime change” operation against its internationally recognized government. A policy that has helped to destabilize yet another Arab country. In Trump’s view, rather than challenging the government of Bashar Assad, the United States “should be working with Damascus against the Islamic State.” If he maintains this position, it will reverse years of wrongheaded thinking from his predecessor, Barack Obama. And let’s not forget Ukraine, which continues to be embroiled in a semi-frozen civil war. The dogs on the street in Kiev know the Petro Poroshenko regime has postponed efforts at building a sustainable peace for one simple reason: the Chocolate King and his advisers were fully sure of a Clinton victory, thus giving them free rein to resume their assault on the breakaway eastern republics of Lugansk and Donbas. Now this dream may lie in tatters. Whereas Obama insisted upon a sanctions program against Russia for its re-absorption of Crimea, Trump has said he would consider recognizing Moscow’s de-facto control of the peninsula. “The people of Crimea, from what I\\'ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” he\\xa0said in July. So, Kiev’s only option now could be to implement Minsk. Yet, that requires legislation that Poroshenko feels he can’t push through his parliament -\\xa0such as granting semi-autonomy to the rebellious east and providing a pardon and amnesty to insurgents - which is jam-packed with radical nationalists. Furthermore, it’s telling that Trump\\xa0refused to meet Poroshenko in New York in September at the United Nations General Assembly. In fact, the president-elect didn’t even acknowledge Kiev’s invitation. However, Poroshenko did sit down with Clinton, which no longer amounts to a hill of beans. Then there’s the Baltics. These countries have received an extraordinary deal over the past decade or more. What Washington has effectively said is this: “We’ll pay for your security, so long as you let us use you to annoy the Russians.” What the NATO blanket has done for the Baltic elites is freed them from having to establish normal relations with Moscow and develop their own military; which of course requires both money and manpower in addition to political will and organization. Something they lack because they’ve failed to develop their economies to a sufficient level that the vast majority of their own youth would want to stay at home. Trump may\\xa0send them kicking and screaming into the real world. He’s suggested how the United States would not automatically defend NATO members unless they pay their own way. “You can’t forget the bills,” he\\xa0told the New York Times.\\xa0 “They have an obligation to make payments.” So far, only Estonia, the most relatively successful of three, shows any interest in doing that. And this brings us to Russia. Let’s be clear here. Short of an actual shooting war, Moscow-Washington relations couldn’t be much worse than they are right now. Both foreign policy establishments are distrustful of each other and it’s clear that Obama and President Putin simply don’t get along. So, Trump’s talk of smoothing matters is truly ground breaking, assuming he follows through on it, of course. On Wednesday morning, Putin said he looked forward to restoring normal bilateral relations with the United States. “We heard [Trump\\'s] campaign rhetoric while [he was] still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,” he said. “[I look forward to] building a constructive dialog between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other\\'s positions, [when it] meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” For his part, Trump has spoken of tearing up years of animosity toward Moscow in Washington and working more closely with the Kremlin. He\\'s also suggested the two countries could work together on fighting terror. He also\\xa0described NATO as \"obsolete\" and Putin\\xa0himself as a “leader.” Naturally, this was used against him in the campaign, where Hillary’s supporters, seemingly unable to fight him on policy, eventually resorted to a smear campaign which\\xa0labeled him a “Russian agent,”“Putin’s useful idiot”and a “Manchurian candidate.” There was even a\\xa0website called “Putin-Trump,” complete with a hammer and sickle illustration in case anyone missed the point of the slander exercise. This is all academic now because Trump has won. And the US establishment, and particularly the interventionist foreign policy bridge that did most to stoke up tension with Russia, has been dealt a crushing defeat. Nevertheless, there are caveats. Firstly, the US has a deeply ingrained “deep state” and they won’t suddenly transform into Russia-loving peaceniks at the flick of a switch. It\\'s also worth remembering how a Republican-controlled congress mightn\\'t always do exactly what he wants, despite the party ties. After all, America’s founding fathers deliberately made executive power hard to apply. And then there’s Trump\\'s own unpredictability. On the fringes of Sochi’s Valdai conference last week, Russian officials made it clear that they were concerned how he might not deliver on his promises. “At least with Hillary we get the devil we know,” was a feeling expressed so often that it became a theme. Despite these worries, Trump does offer one thing: the end of Washington insiders controlling the White House, for the first time since Ronald Reagan. In fact, the parallels with the latter are striking. He was also smeared by the establishment and derided as an idiot. But now Reagan is broadly regarded as a great statesman. Maybe one day we will be able to say the same of Trump.  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Those three states bring the grand total to 13 and the District of Columbia. Altogether, 50 cases of Zika have been diagnosed in the US, all in people who had traveled to one of the 30 countries where the virus is active, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There was also one case of the virus being sexual transmitted in Dallas, Texas. In a new study published on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Ophthalmology, Brazilian researchers reported finding eye problems in 10 out of 29 newborns infected with the Zika virus, for which there is no vaccine or treatment. Retina atrophy, iris discoloration, and lens dislocations were counted among the birth defects, and in seven out of the 10 cases, both eyes were affected.

The first Zika outbreak was identified in Brazil in May of last year, and though it is primarily contracted via mosquito bites, it can also be spread through blood transfusions and unprotected sex, as well as to unborn children whose pregnant mothers are infected. The CDC advises men to use condoms or refrain from intercourse with pregnant women if they have traveled to a high risk country recently. It also recommends that pregnant women be tested two to 12 weeks after returning from afflicted regions. Four out of five people with Zika don’t experience any of its symptoms, which can include fever, rashes, joint pain, muscle pain, red eyes, and headaches – all of which can last up to a week. On Monday, the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center began operating at its top emergency activation level – Level 1. The last time Level 1 was enacted was during the Ebola crisis of 2014. It was also activated in 2009 in response to H1N1 influenza and in 2005 for Hurricane Katrina. ']\n",

Both the Pentagon and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform have announced plans to address the issue. “We are going to look into and resolve it,” Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters on Tuesday, calling it “a significant issue.” The House committee officially opened an investigation on Monday and requested all documents associated with the California cases. Representatives also asked for senior National Guard Bureau official General Joseph L. Lengyel and Major-General David S. Baldwin to brief the Committee by November 17. “The Committee is seeking information about this serious matter, and to see that officials who mismanaged bonus programs are held accountable,” wrote committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) in a letter to Lengyel and Baldin. 'Outraged' Congress may intervene as National Guardsmen ordered to pay back bonuses  https://t.co/PurhLrMToxpic.twitter.com/4Rg8FMRsUx House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) has joined other members of Congress in demanding that the Pentagon cease collection efforts. “Congress has time... to protect service members from lifelong liability for DOD's mistakes,” Stars and Stripes quoted\\xa0Ryan as saying. The problem began over a decade ago, when recruiters offered soldiers up to $15,000 in bonuses for enlisting or extending their service, during a time when the government struggled to recruit troops for the unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2011, it was discovered that many of these bonuses was awarded fraudulently. Corruption and fraud within the management of the National Guard’s incentive programs caused the issue to fester unchecked. California has been the only state audited by the Pentagon so far, meaning that more veterans across the US run the risk of being ordered to repay a minimum of $10,000. To members of the California Army National Guard, the problem is hardly new. Major-General Matthew Beevers told\\xa0the Washington Post on Monday that Guard leaders have tried to resolve the issue before, including going to Congress and asking lawmakers to pass legislation two years ago. The bill was not well-received by the Congressional Budget Office, however, due to concerns that forgiving the debt would have increased spending. On Wednesday, Carter announced that he had ordered the DOD to suspend its efforts to collect the erroneous enlistment bonuses from the California troops, as well as steps to resolve the issue and to streamline procedures so that those who received the bonuses in error or through the criminal behavior of others can seek relief. “This suspension will continue until I am satisfied that our process is working effectively,” Carter said in a statement. He tasked a team led by Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine with creating the streamlined process by the beginning of 2017, with a goal of completing “the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible - and no later than July 1, 2017,” Carter said. \"]\n",

The Turkish speaker says he would “gladly” take part in an economic – and even “naval” – blockade of Crimea and join “a dialog of states that suffered from the Russian sanctions.” The two sides exchange warm words pledging mutual support of the unofficial Crimean Tatar body Mejlis, which has opposed Russia’s reunification with the peninsula.The supposed Turkish leader then stressed he would “never, never” apologize to Russian President Vladimir Putin for downing the Su-24 bomber on the Syrian-Turkish border in November of 2015.\\xa0 An unnamed Turkish official has denied that the telephone conversation with Erdogan ever took place, denouncing the pranksters’ claims as “fake.” “I know nothing of such [telephone] call… The president [Erdogan] cannot be reached so easily. I believe it is a fake, as special communication channels as well as special procedures are used for such negotiations,” a source in the Turkish president’s office told RIA Novosti.However, the pranksters themselves say there are many different ways to reach a targeted person, adding that Erdogan was “neither the first nor the last” high-level official they have managed to get through to for an interview on the radio station Govorit Moskva (Moscow Calling).Vovan and Lexus have become famous (or infamous) in Russia for making fun of high-profile personas, including politicians and celebrities. In September of 2015, they played a prank on Sir Elton John, prompting the iconic musician to boast on Instagram that he had been personally contacted by Putin via phone.

Moreover, he promised that the Turkish leader would personally be tended by the notorious Radical Party leader Oleg Lyashko at the banya. Speaking to LifeNews, Lexus said the conclusion they drew was that Erdogan was not really interested in speaking to Poroshenko, as they had to wait for “a day” to get through. However, the Turkish leader was allegedly relaxed and welcoming, readily offering to keep “Poroshenko” updated with plans on a possible Syria ground invasion, which, however, he refused to disclose on the telephone.

RT: During the Convention, there was a major Black Lives Matter demo and counter demo. You also took part in the gathering. What were your main impressions of the people who took part? Katie Hopkins: It got quite aggressive there yesterday in the square. The police were doing a fantastic job of trying to keep people separate from each other…. People are here to protest because they love to protest. There was someone I met dressed as a wall protesting about Trump. Somebody else is protesting about the fact that he wants to cull immigration. Someone else is protesting about the fact that he is Islamophobic. Everybody is here to protest about something. But what I came away with from Black Lives Matter is that really they have created the divide. Black Lives Matter has created a divide. Because they’ve said: “Black Lives Matter more”. Pick a side, which side are you on? I think that has really created hostility. That is why people are applauding the police in the streets because people are now on the side of the police. I think Black Lives Matter has done a really good thing for the police and for Donald Trump’s campaign, which is all about law and order. They are really working in his favor right now. \\xa0 RT: Trump has said the movement is dividing the nation and criticized alleged calls to honor the sniper who shot dead five Dallas police officers this month. Do you agree with the nominee? Carl Dix: Ms. Hopkins is talking like she knows nothing of the reality here in this country. Because the problem is that this country has said from day one that the lives of the Black people matter for nothing unless they can be exploited and savagely oppressed to build up the wealth of America - from slavery, from sharecropping, Jim Crow segregation and Lynch mob terror. And today, police terror, with the police replacing the lynching mobs, and lynching Black people and other oppressed people here. That is the problem. Black Lives Matter represents saying Black lives no longer can be treated as if they don’t matter. That’s what those people are saying. And I stand with them in many protests and demonstrations. But the other thing I say is that this violence of the police is actually them playing the role of front-line enforcers for a capitalist-imperialist system that enforces vicious exploitation and savage oppression on Black people and other people here in this country, to say nothing of what it does around the world. We need a revolution to get rid of this system and to bring in a totally different, far better system…I am talking reality. Let’s talk about Alton Sterling, a man who was beaten down, tasered, pinned down on the ground and then police pull out a gun after they immobilized him and shoot him several times. Let’s talk about Eric Garner; a man who was doing nothing wrong and police choked him to death. Let’s talk about the fact that those and all other hundreds of other killer cops have all been exonerated. That is the reality that no one should accept. Don’t tell me the stuff about police having a tough job because it is not hard not to murder people. You just have to not shoot them in the back, choke them to death, tase them to death, beat them to death. That’s not that hard. \\xa0 RT: The Black Lives Matter movement surely has a point. We've seen dozens of unarmed black people killed by the police this year alone. Surely you accept something has to be done? Katie Hopkins: I think that you are taking a small slice of this argument. What you need to look at is that black-on-black killing is far greater, it is off the chart; gang killing is off the chart. And these guys are just making a protest statement, they are creating hostility, and as a result in Baton Rouge cops are being gunned down. These gentlemen and ladies are out here doing a fantastic job protecting civilians. That is what we need. And people like Carl are creating the very kind of environment that Trump will flourish in because he is talking about law and order. And what we need is people that will stand up because Blue lives matter and Black lives do not matter more.

Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot, ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.” Obama used the civil rights movement and the struggle to enable African Americans to get the vote to remind the audience of the importance of casting their ballots. “I am reminded of all those folks who had to count bubbles in a bar of soap, beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi,” he said. “Risked everything so that they could pull that lever. So, if I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn\\'t matter who we elect, read up on your history. It matters.” The president pressed the crowd to give him a good send-off by registering people to vote. “If you care about our legacy, realize everything we stand for is at stake, on the progress we have made is at stake in this election,” he said. Obama attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump’s claim that black Americans have “nothing to lose” in voting for Trump over Clinton. \\xa0“[Trump] says we’ve got nothing left to lose, so we might as well support somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people for most of his life,” Obama said. “Well, we do have challenges. But we’re not stupid.” Obama has been criticized for failing to do enough for black Americans during his presidency. Many Americans feel that the first black president has failed to make enough progress for the black community. The founding of the Black Lives Matter movement, numerous examples of police brutality against black people, and a lack of employment opportunities have been cited indications that Obama has not done enough.

Compounding the problem is that ASEAN can’t seem to manage its own internal protocols. This past Tuesday offered a graphic illustration, after a special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Yuxi. First ASEAN\\xa0issued a communiqué. Then it retracted it. As much as that reflects internal dissent among the 10 nation group, it also happens to puncture the Pentagon myth of China’s “isolation”. Meanwhile, a D-Day is approaching; the ruling, by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, on a territorial dispute brought by the Philippines in 2013. The ruling should come by late July or early August. Even if – as expected – it goes against Beijing that still should not be reason to install an insurmountable ASEAN-China divide. Connie Rahakundini, president of the Indonesian Institute for Maritime Studies (IIMS),\\xa0framed the question for Xinhua. There is an ‘ASEAN plus’ mechanism already in place – which is a sort of debate forum including China. And ASEAN is also establishing a code of conduct to prevent unilateral moves. The problem with the case in The Hague is that the Philippines did not try to solve it bilaterally; off the record, ASEAN diplomats admit that would be the only solution. So no wonder Beijing decided not to be a part of the arbitration procedure, and preemptively rejects whatever ruling (which is non-binding anyway), insisting the court has no jurisdiction. The Philippines case is about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation; these are subject to general international law, not the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). At the recent Shangri-La dialogue, Beijing once again detailed its complex strategy in the South China Sea. PLA Major General Yunzhu Yao stressed that freedom of navigation for commercial ships in the South China Sea has not been challenged and would never be challenged. And she hit the heart of the matter; the US has not ratified UNCLOS, so it’s in no position to impose its interpretation of the treaty on any nation, in Asia or beyond. Compare it to Rahkundini, speaking for ASEAN as a whole: \"The United States actually has nothing to do in the South China Sea; moreover it does not ratify the UNCLOS. So it is not appropriate for the United States to meddle or, even worse, demonstrate military might there. The United States has to be wiser and fairer to see the ongoing dispute in the South China Sea.\" Everyone knows this is not going to happen. On the contrary; the Obama administration and the Pentagon are engaged in all out meddling, deploying “freedom of navigation” operations. For his part new Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte very well knows that the arbitration, at best, might give him a better bargaining stance. But still he will have to negotiate with China. And Beijing knows exactly what Manila needs to soften the pill; massive Chinese investment. US State Dept. accuses China & Russia of increasing global tensions https://t.co/sh5hPy5sTcpic.twitter.com/VctVProrJO Both China and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam, are signatories of UNCLOS. But steeped as it is in history, Beijing also stands by its 9-dash line map, with sovereign claims that reach as far as the Vietnamese coast and along Borneo. And yet even the Chinese map as well as the drive towards an aerial defense identification zone does not mean Beijing wants to imperil freedom of navigation in the South China Sea – as Washington insists. This is all about positioning. International law does not specifically forbid reclamation at sea. What China is applying is a quite audacious, self-described “blue soil” strategy. Vietnam, Malaysia and even the Philippines had been carrying out reclamation in the South China Sea for a while. China arrived later, but in full force – building airstrips, lighthouses, garrisons in neglected or abandoned islets in the Spratlys and the Paracels. Once again, this is all about energy; to harness an astonishing unexplored wealth of 10 billion barrels of oil and 30 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. In its search for energy, Beijing is focusing a significant part of its strategy on areas already identified, for instance, by PetroVietnam. And it’s using a game-changer: the HYSY 981 mobile deepwater drilling rig, which the chairman of CNOOC, Wang Yilin, describes as a “strategic weapon” that is part of China’s “mobile national sovereignty”. President Xi Jinping has emphasized over and over again that China will not militarize any reclaimed land. Yet the Pentagon’s insistence on those innocuous “freedom of navigation” operations coupled with USAF overflights can only be interpreted as provocations leading to further militarization. The Pentagon has never been accused of being geopolitically savvy. Their planners after all fail – or prefer to fail - to see that China’s island building, in the long run, is all about finding enough oil and gas to perform an “escape from Malacca”, a central plank of Beijing’s energy strategy. Beijing would rather have enough energy closer to home, in the South China Sea, than having its fleet of tankers at the mercy of the US Navy crossing the Strait of Malacca non-stop. No one knows how the removal of the US weapons sale embargo on Vietnam will result in practice. In Southeast Asian cooperation terms, it might be useful to observe the actions of Singapore – that trade/services hub doubling as a US aircraft carrier parked by the Strait of Malacca. Singapore happens to perform a superb balancing act between Washington and Beijing. Russia, by the way, is also officially neutral on all matters South China Sea. Japan protests Beijing’s warships approaching disputed islands in E. China Sea https://t.co/nLwIGj1fNdpic.twitter.com/ZXaymc5PEe China is the top trading partner of the overwhelming majority of Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia nations. It is a prominent member of the East Asia Summit. It is driving its own, Asian-based response to the Obama administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pet project; the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Beijing knows that the “principled security network” proposed by lame duck Pentagon head Ash Carter in Singapore has no chance whatsoever of becoming a Southeast Asian NATO. What this all means is that the notion of an “isolated” China does not even qualify as a bad joke told at a stuffy Council on Foreign Relations meeting. And that brings us back to what happens after the arbitration in The Hague. Something very Asian; Beijing and Manila will sit down again and try to reach a deal, without ever bothering to refer to the ruling. Face will be saved on both sides. China will continue to go mobile - in search of all that oil and gas. And count on the Pentagon to continue its meddling.

On Sunday, the NYPD commissioner confirmed to reporters that the investigation had discovered “some component indicative of an IED.” “We definitely had a bombing last night on 23rd Street and we had a suspicious device on 27th Street,” James O’Neill said. As emergency and investigative teams rushed to the scene of the explosion, New York State police troopers discovered a second “suspicious secondary device” a few blocks away.

So we’re not taking any options off the table,” NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Sunday. Commenting on the blast in Chelsea, de Blasio said that authorities are looking into possible motives for the explosion before establishing any connections. “Now we know from everything we’ve seen so far that this was an intentional act. I want to reaffirm what I said last night, but again we do not know the motivation, we do not know the nature of it,” the mayor said. “We only know it was organized.

While acknowledging that there is no “immediate threat” to New York, Cuomo, speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday said that “on the side of caution, we will be deploying close to 1,000 state police and National Guard people to police the bus terminals, airports, and subway stations.” Cuomo added that “a bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism” and vowed to find those responsible.

But this can lead to the consequence that this situation may alert its [IS] supporters in Europe, that it can lead to violent attacks,” the BfV chief warned. He added though that security services in Germany are preparing for such an event. “This is what we want to prevent and we also adjust ourselves accordingly, so that it can be avoided.” Maassen did not name any imminent threat facing Germany. Yet according to the intelligence chief, the BfV should prepare itself for “different scenarios,” including cases when “well trained fighters [who could] simultaneously stage suicide attacks or terrorist acts with Kalashnikov assault rifles.” This was the case during IS-inspired terrorist assaults in Paris in November 2015 as well as suicide bombings in Brussels airport and metro station in March this year. “And then we have the case of a lone wolf who is not really a lone wolf because, as we have now encountered in a number of cases, these people are being radicalized and led via instant messenger service, via the internet,” Maassen said. On September 21, police in the German city of Cologne raided a refugee compound, arresting a 16-year-old Syrian refugee over suspicion he was allegedly planning a terrorist attack. Law enforcement officials released a statement saying the young man had attended a mosque in Cologne and “has radicalized himself in a very short time.” The Syrian came to the attention of police on June 10, 2016, after sending IS-related images to his friends. German police are now also investigating whether a 16-year-old girl named Safia, who stabbed\\xa0a police officer in Hannover earlier in October, may have been directed by IS.\\xa0 In response to the case, Maassen said that Islamic State is increasingly trying to address young people via social networks to “radicalize them.” One of the most recent terrorist plots was foiled in early October in the eastern city of Chemnitz, when a 22-year-old Syrian national, Jaber al-Bakr, was captured after a two-day manhunt. Although a special operation had been launched by the authorities, the man was only detained when three fellow Syrians tied him up and alerted police.\\xa0 Al-Bakr later committed suicide in his cell. Prior to the manhunt authorities in Germany had reportedly received a tip-off from US intelligence services that the Syrian was planning a terrorist attack, possibly on Berlin airport, after intercepting his phone calls with IS in Syria. In July, Germany was shaken by several attacks committed by asylum seekers. On July 18 a man believed to be an Afghan refugee injured five people on a train near the town of Wurzburg. While just a week later, another asylum seeker, this time from Syria, launched a suicide attack at a festival in the city of Ansbach, injuring 15 people. In both cases the perpetrators had pledged allegiance to IS. ']\n",

Despite inflation possibly exceeding the Bank of England’s (BoE) target of two percent, Governor Mark Carney said he could tolerate \"a bit” further consumer price growth, propped up by a weak currency. Bloomberg-polled economists expect the BoE to cut interest rates in November from the current historic low of 0.25 percent. “After years of undershooting, he must allow a little bit of overshooting. He cannot push too hard on inflation, it risks upsetting the fragile recovery,” former Bank of England foreign exchange manager John Nugee told the media. Government statisticians say they are waiting for clear signs of impact from the plummeting pound. The main factors of September’s inflation rise were the biggest monthly increase in clothing prices since 2010 and higher fuel costs. However, not all consumer goods became more expensive in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said. “There is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods,” said Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS. The UK’s biggest supermarket Tesco briefly halted online sales of goods produced by Unilever because of a dispute over potential price increases. The news about the inflation rate pushed the pound higher against the dollar. The British currency is almost one percent up on Tuesday against the greenback, trading at 1.2280. ']\n",

Ljungqvist, who served as WADA vice-president from 2008 to 2013, made the admissions in a documentary film shown on Russian television station Channel One. The program led an investigation into the allegedly falsified Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) documents that allowed many athletes to take the banned drugs. The investigation was based on information published by hacker group ‘Fancy Bears’, which revealed six lists of athletes who have been granted TUEs permitting them to take medication at the time of competition. The lists named 127 athletes, including American tennis champion Serena Williams, British cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins, and Team USA’s four-time Olympic gymnastics gold medalist Simone Biles, who confessed that she suffers from ADHD and takes medication that contains banned substances, on the advice of doctors. “When talks began on the topic of TUEs, there were a lot of disagreements in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) hierarchy. If an athlete is suffering from illness and needs to take strong medication, then it is not worth them competing,” Ljungqvist said in the program. “ADHD in teenagers did not present any issue as they rarely compete at the highest level. But when these diagnoses were made for adults, it caused greater problems. There are some high-level athletes using that diagnosis - we know who they are, and you know who they are,” he added. Danish cyclist Michael Rasmussen, winner of the Tour de France in 2005 and 2006, admitted to doping from 1998-2001. He revealed that in many instances where diagnoses are made that give athletes permission to take banned substances, the doctors’ decisions are bogus. “I didn’t have any injuries or illnesses that could warrant a TUE, but I don’t think I am the only one who doped, otherwise I would have always been first. Everything is done quite easily: you write to them saying you have an injury, what medication you need, including a seal of approval by the doctor of the diagnosis, which is forged. In five minutes you can get permission to use banned substances,” he said, TASS reported. “They let me know about TUEs the moment I signed a contract with a top team. We all planned in advance, the doctor said, when we needed to take the substance glucocorticosteroid when you succumbed to fatigue, I could lose weight, but nevertheless not feel weakness in my muscles or any weariness,” he added. On 20 July, Norwegian cross-country skier Martin Johnsrud Sundby was banned from competition for two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for an anti-doping rule violation. His use of asthma medication salbutamol resulted in the test levels of his urine sample exceeding the limits set in anti-doping rules. \"WADA remain tolerant to the asthma issue - even without TUEs it allows as much as 1600 mcg (16 inhalations) on a daily basis,\" the authors of the film say. \"But the dose of the drug used by one of the Norwegian skiers was not just a bit higher, it exceeds the norm by nine times.” According to an investigation by the Norwegian media, 46 of Norway’s 61 Olympic champions since 1992 have used asthma medication which contains banned substances.

UK is breaking the Arms Trade Treaty with reckless sales to Saudi Arabia, say top lawyers https://t.co/VC1ZMzSfn2pic.twitter.com/DS8H674Sav “These figures are deeply worrying, showing that the UK continued to dispatch huge amounts of weaponry to Saudi Arabia despite overwhelming evidence that the Saudi war machine was laying waste to Yemeni homes, schools and hospitals,” the group’s head of policy and government affairs Allan Hogarth said. “As officials were signing off these sales, hundreds – possibly thousands – of Yemeni civilians were dying in a terrifying barrage of indiscriminate Saudi airstrikes in the country.” Hogarth said the law is unequivocal in the context of the Saudi-led airstrikes. “Any Saudi attack, whether deliberate or not, that fails to adequately protect civilians is a violation of international law,” he said. “And our obligations are equally clear – as a major supplier of Saudi Arabia’s weaponry, the UK is legally obliged to suspend arms exports.” >£2.8 billion of UK arms sales approved to Saudi Arabia since it started bombing #Yemen. https://t.co/QyfmjxRXA0pic.twitter.com/PD6M3UJaHi Hogarth dismissed government rhetoric on the UK’s arms trade with Saudi Arabia as “evasive,” and warned that Britain is flogging weapons to the Gulf state in full knowledge that they will be deployed to kill Yemeni civilians. He called upon the British government to face up to the reality of Saudi Arabia’s conduct in Yemen, “immediately suspend export licenses” for further UK arms sales to the Gulf state, and preside over a full inquiry into allegations of grave violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen. Conflict resolution group Saferworld also condemned the spike in sales, stressing that Saudi-led airstrikes had hit civilian-populated areas in Yemen.  “The day after the prime minister [David Cameron] claimed to be ‘trying to encourage a political process in Yemen’ and declared ‘there is no military solution in Yemen’, official figures reveal that in just the three months July to September, the government approved the sale of over £1 billion worth of bombs for the use of the Royal Saudi Air Force,” a spokesperson for the group told the Guardian. “This is the same air force that has bombed hospitals, schools, markets, grain warehouses, ports and a displaced persons camp and helped to turn Yemen into a living nightmare.” Robertson says Saudi airforce in Yemen hv been killing civilians using British bombs. \"Time for PM to admit Britain effectively taking part\" In December, legal analysis commissioned by Amnesty and Saferworld revealed that the British government is breaching domestic, EU and international law by continuing to supply arms to Saudi Arabia. The analysis was conducted by prominent international law experts Philippe Sands QC, Professor Andrew Clapham and Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh. The lawyers, who work for London-based law firm Matrix Chambers, concluded that the UK government is violating its duty under Britain’s Consolidated Criteria on arms exports, the EU Common Position on Arms Exports and the global Arms Trade Treaty by allowing transfers of weapons and other military wares to Saudi Arabia that could be used in Yemen. Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain’s arms trade with the Saudis on Monday, arguing the UK has the most robust export controls on weapons in the world. “In terms of our arms exports I think we have some of the most stringent controls anywhere in the world and I’ll always make sure they’re properly operated,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program. “We’re trying to do everything we can to make sure that the work done by Saudi Arabia is properly targeted and it’s right that we should do that. We’re working with them and others on behalf of the legitimate government on Yemen.” However, Shadow Foreign Secretary Hilary Benn called for increased scrutiny of Britain’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as the humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to worsen. Benn wrote to the foreign affairs, defense, development and business committees, calling for the re-establishment of the House of Commons committee on arms export controls.The watchdog was previously responsible for monitoring Britain’s arms sales, but became dormant in May 2015 after its chair stepped down. “Given the growing number of reports and public concern, I believe the case for a full and detailed assessment of whether there is a clear risk that British weapons might be used in violation of international humanitarian law in Yemen is now overwhelming,” Benn said. “I hope therefore that the new committee will urgently consider examining the government’s approach to these licences.” As Saudi Arabia uses UK weapons to bomb #Yemen, we\\'re hearing a lot about the UK\\'s \\'rigorous\\' export controls... https://t.co/dRZkizU9It RT asked the government whether it plans to suspend further licenses authorizing the sale of UK arms to Saudi Arabia amid allegations that the Saudi-led coalition’s aerial bombing of Yemen is violating international humanitarian law.\\xa0 A spokesperson for the government declined to specify and went on to\\xa0defended\\xa0the Tories\\' oversight of UK arms sales. “We operate one of the most rigorous and transparent arms export control regimes in the world with each licence application assessed on a case by case basis, taking account of all relevant information, to ensure compliance with our legal obligations.

It appears that while trying to gain altitude after an unsuccessful landing attempt in bad weather, one of the pilots pulled the control stick up too much, causing a stall break and an uncontrollable nosedive. The Interstate Aviation Committee believes that the official results of the decoding will be made public within a week or two. Meanwhile, according to Kommersant’s sources, the recorder revealed that flight FZ981 had made two attempts to land in automatic mode, and since a veering squall wind hampered the second attempt, the pilot decided to make a third approach for landing in manual mode. One of the pilots pressed the TOGA (Take off. Go around) button and turned off the autopilot, writes the daily. Anonymous experts Kommersant talked to believe the pilot did not manage the diving rudder and horizontal stabilizer, which steer the plane in opposite directions – down and up, respectively. When the pilot pulled up, he put both the rudder and stabilizer in a sharp climb mode, somewhat fighter-jet style, plus enacted the TOGA regime’s retracted flaps, decreasing ascending force. As a result, the aircraft lost speed and got into the beyond-stall angle of approach. All this led to an uncontrollable dive, the experts believe. #Flydubai FZ981 co-pilot was fatigued, but 'tremendous pressure' made him work – colleague https://t.co/q2MXt7muUUpic.twitter.com/dsUDMxF2Hx At that moment, the voice recorder is said to have registered a conflict between pilots. The pilot that tried to force the aircraft to gain altitude apparently turned the engines to powerful take-off mode, forcing the aircraft to continue its climb. The other pilot believed the situation was dangerous and apparently did the opposite: he pushed his own control over to bring the Boeing’s nose down and prevent the sweeping up, while yelling at his colleague to stop doing it that way. “Wait! Where are you flying? Stop! Stop!” a voice on the recorder reportedly yelled. FlyDubai tragedy: 360 VIDEO of #FZ981crash site in Rostov-on-Don https://t.co/gPbxxoZfNDpic.twitter.com/1xCLeF34Kl The pilots’ contrary actions caused the controls of the aircraft to ‘split’: the Boeing 737’s onboard computer was receiving mutually-exclusive commands from the two controls, which are usually operated synchronously. This rendered the plane out of control. When they felt the plummeting sensation, the crew coordinated their actions, but it was already too late. The Boeing 737-800 was roaring at 325kph downwards at an angle of about 45 degrees. It burst into flames upon collision with the ground, killing all 62 people on board. During the last seconds before the collision both pilots were screaming with terror, Kommersant reports. ‘Modern day slavery’ Emirates and Flydubai pilots reveal exhausting labor conditions to RT https://t.co/MhT50o7eTmpic.twitter.com/lEpE9pNqoA On March 20, Russia’s Investigative Committee named pilot error or technical failure as the prime theories as to the cause of the Flydubai’s Boeing 737-800 crash in Rostov-on-Don on March 19.

US officials have reportedly told NBC News that the CIA is preparing for a possible cyber-attack against Russia. The move, apparently, would be intended as retaliation for Russia\\'s alleged interference in the US presidential election, which is already being called the most scandal-filled contest in American political history. Russia vehemently rejects the claims and says the US has produced absolutely no evidence to support the very serious charges. It is said the attack would also seek to \"harass and embarrass\" the Russian authorities. RT spoke with Jim Jatras for his views on this latest ratcheting up of tensions between the two global nuclear powers. RT: Would there be any justification for the CIA launching a cyber-attack on Russia in the absence of any good evidence Russia tried to interfere in the US presidential election? Jim Jatras: This was given, it appears, as an exclusive to NBC; almost like a press-release that the government is giving out as a warning shot or really a threat against the Russians. And even though they are saying that this is connected to the election, there is no real evidence regarding the DNC and other things on WikiLeaks. What the statement says is that it is geared towards interference with the elections itself, with the voting. Anybody who is familiar with our system knows that that is next to impossible; we don’t have a single nation-wide voting system. We have 50 states and thousands of local, state and county systems, most of which are paper, most of which, even the electronic ones, not connected to the Internet. So the idea that Russia or anybody else could hack into those is just absurd. So, I don’t think that is what this is really about.\\xa0 “I think these threats coming out of America are very much in response to the leaking of many emails which have desperately embarrassed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic and also the American-establishment favorite. So, this is the American establishment retaliating and saying ‘If this continues, then we will do something back.’ However, they are basing that on the assumption that it is Russia that has been hacking all her staff. Let’s face it, [Hillary Clinton] broke the law by hosting thousands of very sensitive emails on her private server for which she has yet to be prosecuted. And it is very likely that most of the leaks come from the fact that her server was vulnerable because it was not protected. I’m willing to bet that the Russian leadership’s private communications are rather better protected.”- Annie Machon, former MI5 agent, told RT RT: Some have condemned the preparations for an attack by branding it \"direct aggression\" against Russia. Could we be close to a cyber-war? JJ: I think we could be. And let’s keep in mind that there are two things here that I think are really behind this - not interference with our election.\\xa0 As we know this whole “Russia, Russia, Russia theme” has been a constant of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. And maybe the Obama administration is trying to help her out a bit by turning up the heat and pointing the finger. Also remember, as of tonight, according to the news reports, President Obama was supposed to think up some kind of response to what is going on in Syria. Maybe this is part of what is related to that.  If the US \"clandestine\" pending cyberwar on Russia was serious:1) it would not have been announced2) it would be the NSA and not the CIA RT: What would the US be trying to achieve by launching a cyber-attack against Russia? Is it a maneuver to redirect attention of the American public from the elections by playing this blame game with Russia?  JJ: It could be, and it really depends at this point whether they actually do something or they just threaten. I noticed one of the things they are talking about doing is hacking into the Russian financial system. And that is somewhat worrisome because for about two years now Russia has been complying with an American law called FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) which essentially mandates turning over a trove of financial information to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) from Russian banks, which includes a lot of metadata and the opportunity to insert spy ware and so forth. So, the Russians may have made this very easy for us. RT: One former US intelligence official has stressed the importance of launching the cyber-attack in order \"not to weaken the credible threat of the US response capability\". What are your thoughts on that statement? JJ: I think it is kind of cyber-saber rattling. They are almost daring themselves to do something just to show that they can and then it becomes a matter of prestige. It is almost like they are daring themselves to do something that may turn out to be quite destructive for everybody (…) As the article said, there is some concern on the American side that if, for example, there was some attack on the Russian financial system many Russians would respond with an attack on our financial system, which would be much more disruptive globally given how central the American financial system is worldwide.

The English Football Association issued a statement on Wednesday confirming it would defy the ruling. FA statement regarding Armistice Day tributes at @England v Scotland. pic.twitter.com/4oRAKE3vAR  “We fully respect the laws of the game and take our founding role on the International Football Association Board extremely seriously,” it read. “The poppy is an important symbol of remembrance and we do not believe it represents a political, religious or commercial message, nor does it relate to any one historical event. “In keeping with the position agreed with FIFA back in 2011 and in what we believe is in accordance with Law 4, para 4, The FA intend to pay appropriate tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice by having the England team wear black armbands bearing poppies in our fixture on Armistice Day.” The Scottish FA also confirmed it “intends to pay appropriate tribute by having the Scotland national team wear black armbands bearing poppies”. FIFA has numerous options available should it decide to punish the FAs for breaking its rules, including a points deduction, but English FA chief executive Martin Glenn doesn’t think that will happen. “We are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the other home nations on this, we all feel very strongly,” Glenn told BBC Sport. “It’s not a political symbol and I think most people would agree with us. We don’t think we are breaking their law – we think they are misinterpreting it. I’m confident it won’t come to anything draconian.” FIFA’s secretary general Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura, who is set to meet senior officials from the four United Kingdom football associations at Wembley Stadium on Thursday, said the rule was non-negotiable. “Britain is not the only country that have been suffering from the result of war,” she said. “Syria is an example. My own continent (Africa) has been torn by war for years. And the only question is why are we doing an exception for one just one country and not the rest of the world.” The latest row mirrors events in 2011 before an international between England and Spain when then Prime Minister David Cameron wrote to FIFA to voice his concerns over the ruling. FIFA eventually allowed England players to wear poppies on black armbands after initially threatening to ban the team from competing. Former England defender Danny Mills has hit out at the row, claiming it is overshadowing the meaning of Armistice Day. He told the BBC\\xa0that the players could get around the ruling themselves without the authorities getting involved. “If the players are that insistent on wearing poppies, they should get a temporary tattoo, stick it on the back of their hand and, when the national anthems are played, put your hand on your heart and it’s there for everybody to see. “FIFA cannot stop that. It’s no different than having a normal tattoo. “It almost seems like the FA are having a fight for the sake of it. It’s becoming about the (English) FA and FIFA rather than actually remembering all those who have lost their lives. “We’re starting to lose what the poppy is about.” ']\n",

There were 325 passengers and 12 crew on board. When they landed at Pearson Airport, all carry-on items and all passengers were scanned with a metal detector wand. Air Canada explained that the 17 passengers were “misdirected” by staff at Charles de Gaulle after connecting from Sri Lanka. They should have gone through an additional screening, but it didn’t take place. However, in another statement, Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the passengers had been screened before boarding the plane in Sri Lanka, and had never left the ‘secure zone’ at Charles de Gaulle. \"We assessed the situation in consultation with Canadian government authorities and determined the flight was secure,\" he told CBC News in an email on Sunday. Despite this, Transport Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) requested another screening after discovering there were \"passengers on board that had not completed pre-board security screening in Paris.\" CBC Radio host, Anthony Germain, was one of the passengers on board, and he told RT about when he first understood things were going wrong. “When we landed, I knew something was different, because usually if you land at a big airport like Pearson in Toronto, the plane – especially the plane with more than 300 passengers – would normally pull up to the gate. I was with my wife, we had a vacation, and I said something is not right here because we are far away from the airport.” An official came on board and informed passengers that they had only received notification of the flawed pre-board checks when the plane was already “halfway across the Atlantic.” Germain believes this situation is extraordinary, particularly in light of recent events. “I turned to my wife and told her, ‘this is very strange, given Paris and everything that happened in France over the last year.’” When the passengers descended to the tarmac to be screened, there was a heavy police presence, and an array of mobile X-Ray machines. Everybody including the crew was screened again, Germain added, calling the situation “strange and alarming.” “If you take a look at how many billions of dollars the modern world has spent to face the threat of terrorism, with everything that’s happened there [in Europe], it seems incomprehensible to me that anyone could get through security not properly screened.\\xa0 “I don’t think this is an Air Canada problem.

The report claims that a deal with a business called Trestellar Ltd, who were used to market the club in the UK and South-East Asia, is under investigation. Leicester City: billionaire owners' deal with company run by Sir Dave Richards' son, which has no telephone number https://t.co/sIU1YB36pa There is a chance that Leicester used Trestellar to escape UEFA’s financial fair play rulings, with the sale of naming rights to the stadium and sponsorship of the team’s shirts clouded in controversy. The report suggests that Trestellar sold the club’s main sponsorships to King Power - a company already owned by Srivaddhanaprabha and as a result Leicester’s income was substantially boosted. Although this accusation is yet to be proven or any action taken, football club owners have long been incriminated for their underhanded financial mismanagement. Manchester City spring to mind when discussing financial fair play, with the Premier League side fined $69 million and handed a transfer cap in May 2014. Man city fan on @5liveSport having a dig at @PSG for financial fair play. Glasshouses an all that. The English club pushed the boundaries of fairness when the team’s owners, led by Sheikh Mansour, sold the naming rights to the stadium to Etihad Airways - also owned by the Abu Dhabi government. This long-term agreement was essentially viewed as the club’s owners unfairly pumping more money into the organization to be spent on players, with the commercial deal a front to mask the fact they had eclipsed financial fair play regulations. Paris Saint-Germain were hit with a similar fine following their extortionate spending after the Qatar Investment Authority’s purchase of the French club. That PSG and Man City can be in the rich list based on 'income' shows what a farce Financial Fair Play is. https://t.co/jh1EsQv4cE Financial skullduggery in football is not a new thing and the Italians have been some of the worst offenders in the modern era. Between 2004 and 2010, a host of Italian clubs, including giants AC and Inter Milan, were found guilty of financial foul play through manipulating the price of players and using false account tricks to pass financial tests from the Italian Football Federation. The most severe punishment handed down was a five-year ban to Enrico Preziosi, who was found guilty of an abnormal transaction between the two clubs he presided over, Genoa and Como. Malaga owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Thani’s time at the Spanish club has not had many dull moments, with financial irregularities also commonplace. The Qatari bought the Andalusia-based club in 2010 and invested heavily. Malaga break FFP = instant European ban. Man City break it = only a fine. UEFA are biased towards big clubs. However, in subsequent years unpaid bills and tax irregularities were reported, with Malaga eventually banned from European competition and hit with fines. The La Rosaleda outfit’s promise of rivaling Barcelona and Real Madrid has since waned, while Al Thani has gone missing to some degree. Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala are also another example of financial shenanigans from a club owner, with Suleyman Kerimov’s role creating a wealth of headlines. Anzhi owner Suleyman Kerimov will stop his financial support to the club if it is relegated this season according to Sportbox. The Dagestani billionaire took over at the Anzhi Arena in 2011 and promised to revolutionize the club. Big spending followed, with Samuel Eto’o believed to have been made the sport’s highest-paid player and Anzhi looking set to become a force both domestically and in Europe. However, when Kerimov stopped the flow of cash in 2013, star players were sold and the dream of dominating Russian football subsequently ended - with Anzhi looking like prime candidates for relegation this season. \"]\n",

Greenpeace leaks confirm protesters weren't kicking up a fuss over nothing\", 'op-edge', 'If there had been any remaining uncertainty over the dubiousness of the proposed US-EU trade agreement, the 248 pages of\\xa0leaks have now removed it. TTIP was already controversial, but it may soon be the political hot potato that no one wants to touch. The leaks reveal that the deal includes provisions which would allow American corporations to exert huge influence over European regulatory laws, potentially weakening public health and safety standards to fall more in line with those in the US. And the kicker? While the US would be granted all of this influence over EU law and standards, there would be “no guarantee of reciprocity.” In practice the deal, if it was signed the way it stands, would give American companies much the same level of influence over and input into EU regulations as European companies have. If EU nations passed laws raising standards, American companies would be able to challenge them. If that seems like an arrangement that benefits one side more than the other, it’s because that’s exactly what TTIP is. No wonder some UK residents aren’t exactly delirious over the prospect of remaining part of an economic bloc that would consider a deal like that. Leaked #TTIP documents reveal scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU environment & public health protections https://t.co/WZRMGkS7n5 But the texts released by Greenpeace expose not only new demands, but efforts to fundamentally change the face of Europe’s basic safety standards, including “details of specific threats” like the “plan to end Europe’s ban on genetically modified foods.” It’s a race to the bottom on public health and safety,\\xa0according to the director of Greenpeace EU. In another particularly interesting revelation, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung\\xa0reported that Washington was threatening to block the easing of European car exports into the US in an effort to force the EU to buy more environmentally risky US farm produce. And, if you were among those concerned about the effects of TTIP on previously agreed efforts to combat climate change, the Greenpeace leaks will have done nothing to mitigate your worries — as none of the 248 pages of leaks made any reference to the supposed global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions, despite repeated assurances from the European Commission that this would be a top priority. The reasons for the secrecy surrounding these negotiations are now crystal clear. It’s not hard to decipher why the European Commission had placed a 30-year ban on public access to the key negotiating texts. If Europeans had known exactly what was being bartered over, there would have been even worse uproar. Now they do. It is a black mark on Western “transparency” and democracy that it was left to Greenpeace to provide the first real insight into how this trade agreement is being negotiated. \\'The words “climate change” were not mentioned once in the 248 pages.\\' Unlikely to appear after 3 yrs of talks https://t.co/EmDL9R28Kc#TTIP But what the leaks also reveal is that a deal is still nowhere near being done. The documents don’t represent a completed text, as Europe’s commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmstrom wrote in a\\xa0blog post on Monday. They represent the negotiating positions of both sides. Malmstrom argues that this makes the “alarmist headlines” nothing more than “a storm in a teacup.” On that she is wrong. Huge divisions and sticking points may remain, but the fact that Europe could even consider “negotiating” around safety standards to benefit American companies is beyond comprehension and certainly newsworthy. Malmstrom vehemently denied that any trade deal would ever lower Europe’s level of consumer protections — and it was a pretty steadfast denial on the face of it. Maybe her next blog post will see her admitting either that this was a lie, or that the deal is headed nowhere but the trash bin, because given what we know of the US’s negotiating tactics, it will be one or the other. You don’t negotiate with the exceptional nation and expect to come out with much to your name. EU leaders had already been waning in their enthusiasm for a deal in recent weeks — a promising sign that perhaps there are still some things which Europe will refuse to be pushed around on. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls had previously warned that if TTIP did not preserve France’s quality of life, the chances of an agreement would fall. Germany’s economy minister has publicly called Washington out for refusing to make concessions. Looking at the fallout from these leaks, it wouldn’t be surprising if that theme continued. Greenpeace: #TTIPleaks reveal US\\'s \"deliberate attempts to change the EU democratic legislative process\" https://t.co/vIWrYuVmDy Unfortunately, this is the point at which I must again mention Vladimir Putin. My apologies for the seeming irrelevance; but the powers that be simply refuse to leave him out of anything at all. Anyway, apparently he hates TTIP — which obviously, is a reason for you to love it. James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander, dedicated a whole\\xa0article to this in 2014. As yet another attempt to fear-monger by casting Putin as a winner or loser in something, it obviously misfired because it’s highly unlikely that any of the\\xa0hundreds of thousands who have in recent months taken to the streets over TTIP, actually give a toss what Putin thinks of it. Not that this would stop the deal’s few fans from doing their utmost to involve him in the debate regardless. In April, Judy Dempsey, editor of the Strategic Europe blog at Carnegie Europe, decided to\\xa0have a go herself. A weakened transatlantic partnership is “to Russia’s benefit,” she says, and TTIP will strengthen that partnership. This is rather strange because the transatlantic partnership had been going pretty strong there for a good while without TTIP. But now, Dempsey warns, the debate has been “hijacked” by a “highly organized” anti-TTIP campaign tinged with “anti-Americanism.” Imagine the horror of highly organized protesters marching against a deal they believed would harm their democracy. Abominable indeed. But it’s all Putin’s fault, because Russia is running a “sophisticated propaganda campaign that does everything to publicize populist and [Eurosceptic] movements and anti-US sentiments.” Only 17 percent of Germans and 18 percent of Americans think TTIP is a good thing — and it’s nothing to do with it being a corporate power grab that spells bad news for both Europeans and Americans. No, no. It’s all because of Putin’s propaganda. A friend of mine who hasn’t kept up with the controversy surrounding TTIP asked me what all the fuss was about yesterday. I explained, in brief, what the Greenpeace leaks had revealed. Her response was simple: “But, why would we sign up for that?” Good question.

            "['15 Dec, 2016 01:07 ', 'Trump security adviser Flynn faces allegations of sharing secret data, despite being cleared', 'usa', 'Retired US Army Lieutenant General Flynn came under scrutiny in 2010 after an unnamed Navy Intelligence specialist accused him - then a Major-General - of leaking secrets to “various” military officers and officials. At the time, Flynn served as US military intelligence chief in Afghanistan. A number of US Army documents, obtained by the Washington Post, show that the informant shared “United States classified information” while in Afghanistan “without proper authorization.” As the case remains classified, the Army’s Judge Advocate General pressed by the Post’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, released only four pages of the “secret” investigation. Following the informant\\'s tip, the head of US Central Command “initiated” a “thorough” probe. Titled AR 15-6, it was conducted by “a properly appointed official,” who found no misconduct in Flynn’s actions. According to the papers, it was established that “the sharing of classified information was not done knowingly and there was no actual or potential damage to national security.”\\xa0 The Department of Defense Inspector General also reviewed the investigation and “concurred” with the findings. “The Commander, CENTCOM review the AR 15-6 investigation and noted the efforts to properly cleanse the foreign officer’s read-books. He further stated that there was no evidence of senior officer misconduct, rather there was keen attention to mission accomplishment in a coalition, combat environment,” the documents read.\\xa0 Hence, no actions were taken against Flynn. Neither has the probe affected his promotion to Lieutenant General as no “legal objections to the nomination” were found by Office of the Secretary of Defense and General Counsel of the Department of Defense either.\\xa0 With Flynn’s “exceptional qualifications and dedicated service,” his promotion\\xa0was strongly supported by the Department of the Army. According to the papers, his appointment as lieutenant general was said to be “in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the United States of America.” While the documents provided by the Post do not reveal the nature of the information shared by Flynn, he himself did not make a secret of the case. In an August interview\\xa0with the Post, he said that the investigation on him “was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat.” Flynn called the probe “substantiated” because “actually I did it,” but stressed that he did it with \"the right permissions.” “Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please,” he told the Post’s Dana Priest, stressing that he was “proud” of what he did. The Post has drawn parallels between Flynn’s investigation and the case of Hillary Clinton, who has for months been under the FBI probe over the use of her home-brewed server and the use of her private emails during her tenure at the State Department. While campaigning for Donald Trump in the race for the White House, Flynn supported “Lock her up” chants and speculated that if he was in Clinton’s shoes he would “be in jail today.” Michael Flynn, who led \"lock her up\" chants, inappropriately shared classified info with foreign militaries: https://t.co/v3mc1vg1lA The Washington Post’s report has stirred harsh criticism from Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn, Jr., who accused the newspaper of spreading “fake news.” Another article by the failing FAKE news that is the Compost..should they continue to operate when they continue to get everything so wrong? https://t.co/m4YoNNnPJE Flynn Jr. has further accused the Post of forgetting that his father was “twice appointed” by the Senate even after the investigation.\\xa0 You seem to forget he was TWICE appointed by the SENATE AFTER the \"investigation\"... https://t.co/m4YoNNnPJE Richard Grenell, who Trump was considering as US ambassador to the United Nations, has also accused one of the Post’s authors, Greg Miller, of failing to “tell readers that General Flynn shared info on the battlefield about the enemy.” . @WashPost fails to tell readers Flynn appropriately shared crucial info ON THE BATTLEFIELD to protect US coalition troops. Absurd bias. https://t.co/eVnwDmDkJw WashPost reporter @gregpmiller fails to tell readers that General Flynn shared info on the battlefield about the enemy. *the battlefield*! Nevertheless, two Democratic senators have requested senior US intelligence officials to review once again the security clearance granted to Flynn. “Based on public reports, [Flynn’s] conduct in positions that require access to national defense information, and his subsequent private practice, appears inconsistent with the professionalism such access requires,” Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) wrote in a letter to FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and OPM acting Director Beth Colbert.  ']\n",
            "['2 Dec, 2016 15:36 ', 'Is The Donald trumped? Clinton scheming to seize White House through backdoor', 'op-edge', 'In fact, it may be just beginning. Anybody who believes Hillary Rodham Clinton has been sent to the political graveyard by a Manhattan real estate developer has forgotten the cruel surprises of recent history (Remember the Greek referendum? Brexit anyone?). Democratic due process has devolved into something like ‘The Hunger Games’ for the rich - a sensational televised spectacle to entertain the elite every four years, while keeping the people believing they can effect real change. Although it may seem implausible to some, Donald J. Trump may be denied the presidency due to a democratic system that has been corrupted to the bone by excessive wealth, power and collusion at the highest levels. via GIPHY As the world media continues to eulogize Cuban leader Fidel Castro, the neocon-liberal establishment is quietly positioning their chess pieces for a power grab of epic proportions. As far as I can tell, there are three stages of this silent coup presently being carried out on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The first step in the process was to\\xa0perpetuate the news that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306-232), he failed to win the popular vote - reportedly by 2.5 million votes, at last count. Clinton’s alleged victory in the popular vote count, which\\xa0continued for three weeks after Nov. 9 (keep in mind that most of the vote monitors had already gone home as these votes were being quietly tallied), could present serious complications for Trump and his chances of entering the White House, as will become clear a bit later. Meanwhile, the blatantly anti-Trump media is conducting “thought experiments” to show how Clinton would have, could have, should have won the Electoral College if only the Electoral map had been spliced and diced here and there across the nation. The implicit media message behind all of this tomfoolery, of course, is that\\xa0Wall Street-approved Clinton deserves her coronation, because, well, that is what the elite want, democratic procedure be damned. This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes; in fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue\\xa0pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place. And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility – and a very high one in this particular battle - of so-called “faithless electors” tipping this contest in Clinton’s favor. This represents the second stage of Clinton’s attempt at reversing the results of the presidential election in her favor. The Electoral College is scheduled to meet on\\xa0December 19 to perform what, under normal circumstances, would be a mere formality of voting for either Clinton or Trump, according to the will of their constituents. Needless to say, however, we are not dealing with “normal circumstances.”\\xa0This is a battle the Democrats have no intention of losing, no matter what the Electoral College results tell us. The 2016 presidential campaign represents an epic power struggle that will determine the trajectory of US domestic and foreign policy like no other contest in recent history. No surprise, then, that neo-liberal lobbying groups have been exerting immense pressure on these electors to ignore the will of the people and “vote their conscience.” You’d be very wrong to think this couldn’t work. If 37 Republican electors essentially break the law and vote against Trump, it will block him from winning the presidency. The Democrat\\'s team of lawyers and political consultants are now\\xa0working around the clock to make this happen. Micheal Baca, a Denver Democrat and a member of the state’s Electoral College delegation, is one of the individuals attempting to persuade Republican electors to discard the will of the people and vote for anybody but Trump. Baca makes no secret about his intentions to override the Constitution and go rogue. “This is not about Hillary,” he said. “This is about trying to stop Donald Trump.” The Democrat full-court press is getting results. Art Sisneros, a Texas Republican elector,\\xa0confirmed this week that he would resign his position rather than perform his Constitutionally mandated task.\\xa0 Before continuing, let\\'s take a moment and perform our own \"thought experiment\" and consider would would happen if Hillary Clinton somehow gets the nod for the presidency instead of Trump. If the country is not completely overwhelmed by coast-to-coast riots and protests, and there is somehow a peaceful transition of power, then Clinton can expect to face four years of the most hostile, uncooperative (Republican) Congress in American history. Although given the number of neocons who openly support Clinton and her hawkish tendencies, there could be points of agreement. In a best-case scenario, there would be - aside from carrying out the necessary task of maintaining ‘law and order’ at home, while continuing on a war footing abroad - a four-year-long government shutdown. America would get its first real taste of what martial law feels like. The American Conservative\\xa0painted the following picture as to what would happen if Trump’s Electoral College victory were rescinded: “Constitutional government would have broken down, and we would be facing something like a Latin American presidential dictatorship. For several years, Washington’s political debate would be reduced to something like a Hobbesian war of all against all.” Is that something we really need? Apparently it is for some folks, and not least of all Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein. And this brings us to the final stage of a possible Clinton coup. It is generally assumed that it was Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate who masterminded the call for a\\xa0recount of votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. That’s not quite right. New York magazine\\xa0reported that on November 17 Hillary Clinton was “urged by a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers to call for a recount in three swing states won by Donald Trump… The group is so far not speaking on the record about their findings and is focused on lobbying the Clinton team in private.” Just one day after the above article appeared (Nov. 22), Jill Stein, who came in dead\\xa0last with about 3 million votes less than Gary ‘What is Aleppo?’ Johnson, announced she would be collecting money to recount votes in the swing states. One of the interesting things about Stein\\'s choice of swing states to hold recounts is that these are the very same places where Trump emerged victorious. Coincidence or not, that alone should have set off some alarms. In any case, the reason Jill Stein and not Hillary Clinton is calling for the recount is evident: Throughout the campaign, the media hounded Trump with a single annoying question never asked of the future loser: Would he accept the results of the election in the event he lost? When Trump said he would take a “wait and see” approach, Clinton assumed a holier than thou position. “Now make no mistake,” Clinton solemnly told supporters, “by doing that, he is threatening our democracy. The peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It’s how we hold our country together no matter who’s in charge.” So now that the tables are turned, Stein is in the kitchen doing the dirty work. And the media suddenly can’t get enough of this woman who haunted the 2016 election campaign like a rare phantom sighting. Here’s how News Busters\\xa0tallied her sudden stardom: “When Jill Stein was the Green Party’s candidate for US president, the networks only gave her 36 seconds of coverage. However, as soon as she launched a campaign to contest the presidential election and demand a recount of ballots in several key states, the evening news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC managed to find 7 minutes and 26 seconds of coverage for her in just four days. That\\'s more than 12 times as much coverage as in the entire campaign.” Shame on Donald Trump for objecting to #Recount2016, which makes it even more expensive: https://t.co/wzH7WiIFHl But it gets better. Stein has managed to accumulate a massive war chest to carry out the recount - $7 million at last count (or about seven times what she received during her entire presidential campaign). At one point, her recount drive was pulling in almost $5,000 every minute. Somehow that doesn’t sound like Joe Voter digging deep in his Levi\\'s; that sounds more like big league spenders stepping up to the plate. Incidentally, when Stein first started passing the hat around, she said $2.5 million would be plenty, thank you very much. Yet every time she hit the target, a\\xa0higher threshold was introduced.\\xa0 Is Stein’s recount campaign really about collecting some easy money while giving the Green Party some much-needed attention? Or is Stein just trying to shed some light on the dry rot gnawing away at the foundation of US democracy? All that, however necessary, seems very unlikely. After all, the recount plan was initially floated to Hillary Clinton, not Jill Stein. Thus, we must assume this is all part of a major power push for the Democrats to steal the White House from Donald Trump. As Paul Joseph Watson summed\\xa0up the situation: “Her entire campaign was backed by an establishment that wouldn’t hesitate to exploit a recount to carry out the vote fraud they thought they didn’t need on Election Day.” Exactly. And here is where we can fit the last piece into the puzzle to understand what is really going on here. If the recount effort alone won’t make much of a difference to either Clinton or Stein’s chances of overturning the massive edge that Trump now enjoys, then why are they bothering themselves? Hold onto your seats, folks, this gets interesting. The answer boils down to simple arithmetic, as well as some monkey play in the system. Presently, Michigan has already agreed to a recount, which will be carried out this weekend and require hand-counting of ballots in the regions. This process will take many days. Federal law requires the recount to be finished by Dec. 13 – just six days before the Electoral College is expected to cast its votes. Wisconsin has already agreed to a recount, while Pennsylvania is dragging its feet. In other words, this process will probably take us right up to Dec. 19 – the date the Electoral College is supposed to cast their votes (Why the Electoral College vote isn’t valid without these voters, who could go rogue, is a question for another day). Keep in mind that the total number of Electoral College Votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania equals 46. Now take Trump’s 306 Electoral votes and subtract that amount. This leaves you with 260, which is below the 270 required for a candidate to be automatically considered the winner of a presidential election. Do you see where this is going? Now if this recount should start to point toward a Clinton victory in these three swing states, this will present Trump with a very serious quandary. Should he kick up a fuss and protest the recount on the grounds that he won the Electoral College, this could provoke some sort of “constitutional crisis” that prevents the recount from being completed by the Dec. 13 deadline. via GIPHY Now, if the matter remains unsettled by Dec. 19 this could - technically speaking - give the Electoral College’s “faithless electors” yet more reason for not aligning themselves with their constituents. Or, on the other hand, the Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania votes could be considered forfeited because they failed to resolve the issue by the Dec. 19 deadline. So if it did come down to this, who do you think will be selected – possibly by the very Supreme Court that Trump hopes to disband once in office – to be the 45th president of the United States? Yes, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the candidate we have been told got 2.5 million more popular votes than Donald Trump (I would suggest Trump start a serious process to challenge those votes right now). For those who still doubt this possibility, please consider the two latest failed grassroots movements of our times –\\xa0Brexit and the\\xa0Greek referendum - two examples of ‘democracy in action’ that the political elite has de facto canceled or put on hold indefinitely. Such dramatic setbacks, which are becoming the rule rather than the exception, lend credence to Mark Twain’s famous observation that “If voting made any difference they wouldn\\'t let us do it.” In other words, the elite will always get what they want, regardless how the votes goes. Clinton seizing the White House through the backdoor would not be the strangest thing to happen in old Washington. Just ask George W. Bush how he got elected president in 2000 by the Supreme Court, not We the People. @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

RT: What do you think about the power of leaders and their power of decision making to influence policy, regardless of whom is now in the White House? Do you think it will have a significant impact on America’s relationship with Russia, which has been used as a boogeyman by the Clinton campaign? Is that something that concerns American voters? John Mearsheimer: No, I don’t think most [Americans] care much about foreign policy in general. They care mainly about domestic politics and the state of the American economy. I don’t think that all this talk about Russia being a boogeyman is going to have much influence on the election. I think that Hillary Clinton will win a decisive victory and I don’t think it will change US-Russian relations very much if she takes office, as I predict. But if it does change things in a meaningful way, it will make all for the worse because she is a hawk on Russia, she is very anti-Putin and she is surrounded by advisers who are very hawkish on Russia. So, there is no reason to expect any improvement in US-Russian relations in the near future. I say that with great regret. \"Every four years, the Russian question becomes more and more prominent. I am not sure why this is the case. Haven’t they got enough issues and problems of their own to discuss. Secondly, it is almost certain that Hillary Clinton will win and therefore now we need to start thinking what political consequences will emerge out of that. On the one side (…) she initially said she would impose a ‘no-fly zone’ in Syria. She will temper that, and try to negotiate that, so it is not immediately a situation of war. But on the other hand, some of her team are talking about possibly the imposition of more sanctions on Russia. Now sanctions are a type of warfare, so I think that is a catastrophic way forward (…) This isn’t a Cold War, this is worse than the Cold War, the Cold War was about managing conflicts, this is about conducting conflicts, and that is much worse. And I am afraid that Hillary Clinton is one of these people who is really keen to continue and gets stuck into that battle.\" - Richard Sakwa, professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent RT: In terms of EU-Russian relations, the EU summit has just finished and new sanctions at least are agreed for Russia and the old ones still remain. Do you think sanctions are what is needed right now? Are they constructive, because both sides have obviously been affected by them? JM: The sanctions are all about the Ukraine crisis. That is why the West put these sanctions on the Russians. In the West, especially in the US, we blame the Russians for causing the Ukraine crisis. And the idea is that we put sanctions on and keep those sanctions on the Russians until they change their behavior. The fact is that the Russians didn’t cause the Ukraine crisis; the West did for the most part. And the sanctions are not going to work. But it is almost impossible for me to see the Americans taking those sanctions off any time soon. So, I think there is a little hope that we are going to solve the Ukraine crisis and I think US-Russia relations will continue to be bad.

According to Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the confiscation on March 10, was made in accordance with “the decision of the political level and the examining of the professional authorities” which have declared the territory to be “state lands.” The land now in Israeli possession and unless a 45 day appeal process goes through will be used to expand Jewish settlements and for building tourism and other commercial facilities. The EU condemned such activities. “Any decision that could enable further settlement expansion, which is illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace, will only drive the parties to the conflict even further apart,” the EU said. “The European Union remains firmly opposed to Israel’s settlement policy and actions taken in this context, including demolitions and confiscations, evictions, forced transfers or restrictions on movement and access,” the statement added. Brussels is the latest international entity to have condemned the land seizure, the biggest since August 2010, when Israel confiscated almost 1,000 acres in the West Bank. The United Nations and the US were the first to speak out against the latest appropriation on Tuesday. UK, Germany and France followed suit in condemning the seizure of territory. The UK’s Foreign Office said that such “steps clearly damage the diminishing prospects for a two state solution,” as the office called on Israel to “end to settlement expansion, which is illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace.” #Map Israeli occupation declared 2342 dunums as \"state land\" in the southern #Jericho entrance #Palestinepic.twitter.com/kSIVkHrH98 “This decision sends a wrong signal at the wrong time,” the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

He went on to say that the US and Russia have a real chance of finding a common ground in such fields as combating international terrorism. “I very much hope that the very early item on agenda between the incoming Trump administration and Russian administration will be finding ways on working together on that,” Brenton said, referring to the issue of fighting Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. However, the former UK ambassador to Moscow also said that “in Washington, there is quite a lot of doubt about how far he will be able to go” in improving relations with Russia and emphasized that it just equally depends on Russia. Brenton called for caution in making forecasts by saying that Trump’s decisions are still interim ones and not the final ones, so everybody has to see “how relations will evolve when Trump [enters] office.” At the same time, Brenton criticized Trump’s approach toward NATO and said that the Alliance’s “unity” still plays an important role in dealing particularly with Russia. “NATO solidarity is absolutely crucial” in the face of “new active and troublesome Russia,” he said, criticizing Trump for the statement in which he said that the US may consider dropping out of the alliance because European members of NATO were not pulling their weight. Brenton called such an approach “mistaken” and emphasized that US “security is not just about America but it is also about American key allies.” Instead of planning to drop out of NATO, Trump should “encourage the NATO states to spend more on defense,” Brenton said, adding that the UK would “certainly” help the Trump administration in such efforts.

They believe that the federal ownership of the land is unconstitutional and that it should belong to the local community. “The laws on the books that are not constitutional, they are so tremendous, there are so many of them that every day you and I are breaking them and that’s part of the problem,” Bundy said. “Government has got to the point when they think they can make laws on anything.” Bundy says that people are left with the choice of either obeying the government-imposed codes or making the government follow the US Constitution. His group, which came up with the name \"Citizens for Constitutional Freedom\" (CCF) after repeated media queries, is not lacking in resources, despite what some have assumed. There are offices, bunkhouses, workshops and a mess hall stocked with plenty of food. One conference room, where CCF meets with locals or the militia-aligned \"Committee of Safety,\" is also used for storing federal government documents. Bundy admits to poring over files detailing how the feds interact with each other as well as neighboring ranchers. “We always put everything back in where they’re supposed to go, but we’re definitely looking through and seeking for different things, like, you know, how did they take so-and-so’s water rights away and kind of what their perception of those things are,” Bundy said. Oregon refuge occupiers dismiss armed supporters, start negotiating with FBI https://t.co/cR7RAjwoLXpic.twitter.com/JgJURpPLB5 The group has also made use of the federal government’s, or as Bundy would have it, “the people’s” heavy-duty farm machinery. In one case, they drove a Caterpillar loader to a fence separating federal land from private property, then they knocked down the fence to open up more grazing space for a neighbor rancher’s cattle. “It’s been used against them for so long, and now we’re going to use it for their benefit,” Bundy said. “For example, they go out and they use this equipment to build fences, and it cuts out their ranch, and so they can’t use it anymore.” While it is not clear exactly how many people are occupying the federal grounds, the passion of many is undeniable. James Stanton, a disabled and retired Navy diver from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico, arrived with a heartfelt gift for Bundy. Stanton’s old Navy uniform jacket symbolizes his past military service, and was dedicated to Bundy. For Bundy, it’s an example of “what’s happening across the country.” “I don’t think people would be here if they did not see that there is truly a problem, and that if they did not have hope that we could resolve it, and that’s what we’re doing here,” Bundy said. The activists, many of whom are not from Oregon, claim that they are standing up for a pair of local ranchers who are serving a five-year prison sentence for what they deem to be trumped-up charges. Dwight Hammond and his son Steve were charged under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act for a couple of fires they set on their own property, but which reached federal land. The first was in 2001 and was put out by the Hammonds, but the second, in 2006, was put out by federal firefighters. The judge that sentenced them ignored the mandatory minimum provisions of the law and sentenced Dwight to three months in jail, while Steve received a year and a day. However, they were forced back to jail after serving those sentences when federal prosecutors successfully appealed for the mandatory minimum sentence of five years for each man. The militia activists are also unhappy with the way the government manages the land in the area, saying it leaves little for local ranchers. ']\n",

Search engines doing work on behalf of the government or local authorities are not subject to the new regulations. The new law does not permit information concerning criminal prosecutions to be deleted or edited, even if the person has already served their prison term. In addition, a state employee cannot demand that information on their personal income or property be hidden. The search engines are only obliged to delete search results, leaving the actual information on web platforms untouched. Requests can only be filed personally, the only exception being parents demanding that links to inaccurate information about their children be deleted. For instance, Russia forbids disseminating the personal details, including address, of underage criminal suspects. The law gives a search engine three to ten days to fulfill a user’s request. If a search service refuses to delete the links, the person who filed the complaint has the right to go to court and get a warrant. Fees on indexing services for non-compliance with court decisions could reach one million rubles (over $13,000). Although the bill passed a first reading in parliament almost unanimously, criticism from internet professionals prompted considerable changes in the bill. Russia’s State Duma introduced some mechanisms preventing the elimination of truthful information and inked out a regulation obliging search engines to automatically eliminate links older than three years.

READ MORE:\\xa0Peace in Syria - it's the last thing the US wants RT:\\xa0Reacting to the reports in Palmyra, the French foreign minister has accused Russia of losing that city and swapping it for Aleppo. How appropriate is that statement? Peter Ford: It is a gross distortion. And what is actually interesting is that the American-led coalition, which has very powerful surveillance tools, failed apparently to pick up the 4,000 ISIS jihadists making their way to Palmyra with all the equipment and trucks. Failed to pick these up and didn’t lift a finger to try to stop it happening. Now we can only speculate why they did that, but I don’t think you have to be genius to work out that there are plans to decamp the ISIS rebels from Mosul into eastern Syria. This will play into the American narrative that Assad can’t control the countryside in Syria and that he is not a good ally in the fight against ISIS. In fact, the opposite is the case. Once the 50,000 Syrian government forces who are currently engaged in Aleppo are released from those duties, then they can turn their attention to ISIS.

And the American strategy plays into this. We can forecast a scenario where Mosul is on the verge of falling to the Iraqi US-backed forces, and safe passage is arranged for ISIS fighters.

They’ve lied in the past and they’ve also exaggerated many claims about what damage was done by the WikiLeaks. Where, in fact… there was no damage whatsoever. And it was, actually, just embarrassment,” he said. According to the activist, the State Department is rooting for Clinton in the US presidential election to take place on November 8. “It seems to me that the State Department, who’s chummy with Hillary Clinton because she was the Secretary of State (in 2009-2013), would try to control anything that might come out before this election,” he said. Despite the internet cutoff, “the relationship between Ecuador and WikiLeaks and Julian Assange is still very amicable. They’ve been a wonderful host for letting him be a guest for four years,” Stoeckley said. Stoeckley again urged Swedish authorities to drop sexual assault allegations against Assange to finally allow the WikiLeaks founder to leave the Ecuadorian embassy. “Sweden, the US and UK need to end the prosecution against him. And this ongoing case in the US and whatever is going on Sweden needs to come to an end because the UN has said there’s been a huge violation of human rights. There’s no evidence against Julian,” the activist said. When asked if there would be an even greater clampdown on whistleblowers in the weeks before the US vote, Stoeckley replied that “it doesn’t really matter.” “What really matters is showing the inside workings of how Hillary has run her campaign; how the DNC has run their campaign. It seems as though she’s going to win. So we need to be looking forward into what her administration is going to be like and how she plans to continue to run in four years,” he said. Blaming WikiLeaks for trying to thwart the election is useless as it’s “a little late” to do it at this point, the activist said. “And I also think that it’s never been Julian’s motive. He would certainly publish anything that came forward on Donald Trump as well. Unfortunately, nothing has,” he said. Ecuador said that Assange’s internet cutoff was a temporary measure, explaining it by the WikiLeaks intervention in the US presidential election. \"The Government of Ecuador respects the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states.

Thirty-six percent said they did not know whose ideas were best, while 30 percent trusted the Tories the most, against 16 percent for Labour. On all fronts, people seemed to prefer the policies of Jeremy Corbyn, but similar political views did not translate into support for the Labour leader. “There is a worrying disconnect between the economic policies that many voters support and the parties they associate with those policies,” said MRC chair and author Justin Schlosberg. “We feel that much of the media have been more preoccupied with dismissing Jeremy Corbyn as ‘unelectable’ than with seriously reporting on the policies he represents. “Since the economy is often the issue that wins or loses general elections, it is imperative that journalists now give due attention and scrutiny to the economic alternatives put forward by the official opposition, as well as other anti-austerity parties.

He accused Cameron of undermining the very principle he was attempting to achieve by neglecting Westminster. Europe Minister David Lidington, speaking for the government, attempted to pacify those who believed the draft deal is not strong enough, stressing the government is “in the middle of a live negotiation and in a very crucial stage.” Speaking in Chippenham, the prime minister laid out the renegotiation plans, saying he has achieved much of what he set out to do, and the new measures will allow Britain to opt out of “ever closer union.” He also says Britain will not be discriminated against as a non-Eurozone country and extolled the migrant benefit compromise.\\xa0 The prime minister confirmed that it may only be \"a few months\" until a nationwide referendum.

The autopilot feature has seen significant improvements, but comes with new limits on where the futuristic technology can be used. The intelligent system can now recognize curves on the road better and adjust the vehicle’s speed based on the information. However, drivers – or, perhaps more accurately, riders – can no longer use it in residential areas or on streets without a divider. Nonetheless, the CEO believes that autonomous driving will be ready for a true release within the next 24 to 36 months, when Tesla cars “will be able to drive virtually all roads at a safety level significantly better than humans.” “It’s probably better than a person right now,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call with reporters on Sunday. Tesla’s autopilot software collects data from every Tesla car on the road and analyzes it in the company’s intelligence network, improving the system’s understanding of how drivers behave in certain situations and specific areas. Though it’s still in beta, the accumulated experience is then passed on to individual cars in the form of regular software updates. Musk told reporters that he concluded the updates were necessary after seeing dozens of videos of people doing unsafe things with the autopilot systems and posting the videos online.

The murder occurred during a period of high racial tensions and violence as the state introduced school segregation. Tyler was released on Friday after pleading guilty to the crime. He was handed a reduced sentence of 21 years, but the 57 year old has already served nearly twice that, so he is now free. In 2012, the US Supreme Court ruled\\xa0that life without parole for juvenile offenders was unconstitutional. Earlier this year, this ruling was extended to include retroactive cases, meaning prosecutors could seek a reduced sentence for Tyler. Tyler spoke in court Friday and expressed his sympathy to the Weber family, according to\\xa0the Times-Picayune. \"I accept responsibility for my role in this. I ask for prayers for the Weber family and for my family, and for healing in the days and weeks to come,” he said. “Fundamentally unfair” The case drew concerns and criticism that Tyler was convicted unfairly. Tyler was on a bus packed with over 60 fellow black students passing up to 200 white students, some throwing bottles and rocks, when Weber was shot. Police found no weapon during early searches of the bus, but later discovered one stuffed into a seat - a gun allegedly stolen from a firing range used by investigating police, according to an Amnesty International report\\xa0in 1994. Having been tried as an adult and originally sentenced to death, Tyler became the youngest person in Louisiana on death row. A number of the students - black and white - who testified against Tyler revoked their testimonies after his sentencing. His sentence was commuted to life in prison after the state’s mandatory death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1976, and the state parole board later voted three times to further reduce his sentence. In 1980, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals called his conviction “fundamentally unfair” over the judge’s directions to the jury and ordered a retrial, but the court later reversed its ruling on the retrial. Angola Tyler was jailed in the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary or ‘Angola’, also referred to as the ‘Alcatraz of the South’, which is the largest maximum security prison in the US. He spent eight years in solitary confinement, a practice widely criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Earlier this year, the last of the ‘Angola 3’ was released from Angola after spending more than 40 years in solitary confinement - the longest period in US history.

It has to be reliable and high-quality, as shaving takes longer up here than at home,” explains Borisenko, as he dumps the shavings onto the air ventilation system (“any that are not sucked away will be vacuumed up during our weekly clean-up.”) Cleaning teeth is fussier, and together with a standard toothbrush and toothpaste, requires a bag of water for rinsing – which poses a problem once the ritual is over. “On Earth you would simply spit out the water into the sink, but we don’t even have sinks here. So, we have to use a towel,” says Borisenko, as he carefully dabs his mouth with it, making sure that not a single drop of water escapes to float freely through the ISS corridors. The towel is then dried, and reused the following day. As in any cramped flatshare, respect for others using the same space is paramount. “I am going tidy everything up after myself,” promises Borisenko. “It’s always unpleasant when you come to clean yourself up in the morning, and there are smears on the mirror left from the previous person using it.” With the cumbersome but reassuring sequence complete, Borisenko is now ready for the first meal of the day – breakfast in space. But that deserves its own separate instalment. You can watch the next video (and previous transmissions) from Space 360\\xa0on our dedicated website, available in six languages. The project is a joint initiative of RT, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos, and Energia Rocket and Space Corporation, which delivers crews and cargo to the ISS. ']\n",

Bahrain, a small Arab monarchy in the Persian Gulf, has a population of 1.3 million people. Fewer than 50 Jews are among them, according to estimates from Israeli media. Hanukkah, also known as the Jewish Festival of Lights, marks the rededication of the second Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which took place in the second century BC. The holiday usually starts at the end of December and is celebrated for eight days. This year it began December 24 and will end by January 1, coinciding with Catholic Christmas and New Year.

Back then, he said that “the call to war against terror needs to come from the leaders of all the religions as one. “Here in Bahrain members of all the religions live with no fear, and we will continue to allow Jews to live peacefully and quietly, maintaining their lifestyle, their customs and the commandments of their religion without any fear,”\\xa0he added.

He criticized certain Western media for the “cynical use of this tragedy in anti-Russian propaganda material,” calling it a “moral crime.” “We have repeatedly stressed that the Russian Air Force planes operating in Syria never work on targets within residential areas,” Konashenkov said. “It is all the more relevant regarding al-Qaterji, mentioned by the Western media, as it is adjacent to the exit corridors for locals which were opened in the framework of the Russian humanitarian mission,” he added, as quoted in a Defense Ministry press release. Russian monitoring groups have noted daily terrorist strikes in the area, conducted using makeshift artillery mounts. The terrorists, the Russian humanitarian mission says, “target roads, streets, and residential buildings in the close proximity of the humanitarian passages.” “It is done to disrupt any attempts to receive medical and other kinds of aid for eastern Aleppo residents, who are basically terrorist hostages now. “The nature of the debris shown by Western broadcasters during the operation to save [the wounded boy, Omran Daqneesh] demonstrates that there are intact windows in a building nearby, and this in turn shows that the strike, if it happened, was carried out not using aircraft ammunition but a mine or a gas cylinder, which are commonly used by terrorists,” Konashenkov also said. The Russian statement comes a day after images of an ash-covered boy who survived an airstrike in Syria spread online. The video showed the boy, named as Omran Daqneesh, being rescued from a ruined building in Aleppo. Around two weeks ago, Russia and Syria began a large-scale operation to open special exit corridors in Aleppo for civilians and those ready to lay down their arms.

Children respond to immigration decision: I am American #SCOTUSpic.twitter.com/DK7RW1fCk3 The Obama administration in late 2014 began its attempt to bypass Congress with an executive order that would have granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. However, lower courts have since blocked its implementation after 25 states joined Texas in a lawsuit against the order that claimed that such an action was not within the president’s power. The administration continuously appealed as courts ruled against block the order, until it reached the Supreme Court, which has had only eight members since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. A tie vote means that the court can’t issue a ruling, which effectively upholds the lower court’s ruling against the White House. The administration’s amnesty program is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA for short. It would shield illegal immigrants from deportation to allow them to seek lawful employment, and also expand an already-existing program that allows young people to stay in the country if they are under 16. Deeply saddened by divided #SCOTUS decision in #USvTexas. We should be keeping families together, not tearing them apart! The states that were against the move, which were all led by Republican governors, had legal standing based on the claim that DAPA would force them to provide government services to newly protected illegal immigrants. Current estimates put the number of illegal immigrants in the country at 11 million. The administration says that deportation of so many people would be unfeasible, but critics of this stance point at that the purpose of enforcement of any law is deterrence even if every single offender can’t be brought to justice. The White House’s proposal isn’t dead from the tie vote, since the issue will return to a lower court. It is very unlikely that it will go into effect during the remainder of the Obama presidency, however. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters that the House of Representatives came out in support of the courts’ rulings because it was an issue of separation of powers. “It’s a win for Congress and it’s a win for the separation of powers,” he said. “Presidents don’t write laws. Congress writes laws. And today the Supreme Court validated that very core fundamental principle.” Hillary Clinton said in a tweet that she was saddened by the ruling, echoing others who say that US immigration policy breaks up families. Unlike most countries, children of illegal immigrants born on US soil are granted “birthright citizenship” and have the option to stay. Their parents do not have such an option and can be deported. Today\\'s heartbreaking #SCOTUS immigration ruling could tear apart 5 million families facing deportation. We must do better. -H President Obama spoke to reporters following the ruling, saying that he disagreed with the outcome. “I took steps within my existing authority to make our immigration system smarter, fairer and more just,\" he said. “But today’s decision is frustrating for those who seek to grow our economy and bring a rationality to our immigration system.” The president also used the opportunity to chastise the Senate for not considering his nominee for the Supreme Court, using the court\\'s tie vote as an example of why a full\\xa0 bench is necessary. \"The Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision.

Not only did he marry Melania, but he also appeared on both the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as well as entertainment news show Access Hollywood. But Trump may be regretting the latter, as he was caught talking on a hot mic with host Billy Bush. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump is heard saying on a recording obtained by the Washington Post and released Friday. While he had recently married Melania at the time of the recording, it is never specified when the events he described took place or the identity of the woman he is referring to. I\\'m sure John f Kennedy never talked about a woman that way “I did try and f*** her. She was married,” he continues. “And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.’” Unfortunately for Trump, it seemed that furniture shopping wasn’t enough for the married woman to have sex with him. “I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married,” he said, adding, “Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.” Bush also engaged in this discussion. As the Access Hollywood bus pulls up, the men seem to acknowledge actress Arianne Zucker waiting for them. “Your girl’s hot as s***, in the purple,” Bush says. “Woah!” Trump replies in kind, “Woah!” “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,” Trump says. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” This is like when you translate something from another language and Google doesn\\'t quite get it right. pic.twitter.com/7Q6Q9HThnt It gets worse. “And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything,” Trump says.“Whatever you want,” chimes another voice that the Post identifies as NBC’s current Today show host, Bush, who deleted his Twitter account on Friday. “Grab them by the p***y,” Trump says. “You can do anything.” It is important to note that regardless of star power or social standing, one should not grab another person by their genitals without consent. A statement from the Trump campaign called the conversation “locker room banter” and “a private conversation that took place many years ago.” Trump redirected scorn back towards the Clintons, saying “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course – not even close.” “I apologize if anyone was offended,” he concluded. While Trump may write off his comments as “boys will be boys,” other Republicans have responded by distancing themselves from him. As a result of the audio recording, Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan has disinvited Trump from a Wisconsin event. It was meant to be the first joint campaign event, but now Ryan will handle it solo. “I am sickened by what I heard today,” Ryan wrote in a statement. “Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. “ The whole \"everyone sins in private\" excuse for Trump sorta forgets the huge gap between being gross and bragging about sexual assault. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus released a short statement Friday evening, saying, “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” This is not the first time Trump has been accused of sexist behavior this month. On October 3, multiple contestants and crew from the Apprentice told\\xa0the Associated Press that his treatment of women on the show was questionable. Contestant Poppy Carlig recounted Trump asking her to twirl for him, but believed it to be “playful banter,” adding, “He said I reminded him of his daughter and I thought that was really touching because I know how much he values his family.\" It is a rare occurrence for Trump to offer apologies. This week, Trump was asked about a full-page ad he took out in multiple newspapers calling for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York State in relation to the Central Park Five. The Central Park Five were five minority teenagers in New York City who ranged in ages from 14 to 16 years old who were falsely convicted of a brutal rape in 1989. DNA evidence has since exonerated the men who spent between six and 13 years of their life in prison after the actual rapist confessed. When questioned by CNN’s Miguel Marquez on whether he recalled calling for their execution, Trump doubled down, saying, \"They admitted they were guilty,\" despite the fact that none of the five teens admitted to raping the woman and the confessions they made were believed to have been coerced out of the teenagers. \"The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.\" No DNA evidence was found that connected any of the boys to the crime, but semen collected from the victim did match Matias Reyes, the man who confessed in 2002. Since news of the comments spread, more Republicans have distanced themselves from him.

When reporters asked Pispanen about the possibility of Khodorkovsky applying for political asylum in a chosen country, she answered that the same question had been asked about three months back, and that the answer to it remains the same – Khodorkovsky has promised to think about it. In late December 2015 the Russian law enforcement agency dealing with especially serious crimes – the Investigative Committee – said that the former head of the Yukos oil company had been arrested in absentia and put on an international wanted list. The agency spokesman elaborated that Khodorkovsky was suspected of conspiracy to murder two or more people – a crime that can carry a life sentence in Russia. In June 2015 the Investigative Committee reported that it had re-opened the criminal case that was started after the murder of Vladimir Petukhov – the mayor of the Siberian city of Neftyugansk who came into conflict with Yukos stakeholders and managers and was killed on June 26, 1998, Khodorkovsky’s birthday. Five primary suspects, including Yukos co-owner Leonid Nevzlin and head of Yukos’ security department Aleksey Pichugin, have already been tried and sentenced, but the probe into their crimes continued until 2015 because investigators wanted to reveal their accomplices and primarily who ordered the hits. In December 2015 the Investigative Committee summoned Khodorkovsky for questioning as a suspect in Petukhov’s assassination.

Four recruits died between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, and in June another reopened inquest found that Private Cheryl James’ death in November 1995 was not the result of foul play. However the inquest was extremely critical of the culture at the Royal Logistic Corps base, finding evidence of bullying and a “highly sexualized” environment. Both recent inquests were forced through using the Human Rights Act which the government is currently pledging to repeal on the grounds it is used to attack the military with “vexatious” claims. Benton’s sister Tracy Lewis told the Guardian Friday: “Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death. For that reason, our parents are not here with us to see this day.” She said that the intervening decades had seen the family “tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut.” “If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain.” The original inquest lasted just two hours and Lewis said that it “should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey police that our mother had to fight for so long.” “We look forward to finally discovering the truth,” Lewis added.

The company added that cooperation between the two companies include the projected construction of the second aircraft of its kind in Ukraine and its handover to China at the first stage of the project, as well as the creation of an aircraft production line under a Ukrainian license in China at the second stage. Representatives of Antonov Company told UNIAN that each stage of the project will be implemented under a separate contract. The two companies did not reveal any further details about the agreement and said nothing about the project deadlines or the planned numbers of the AN-225 aircraft set to be built in China. Earlier, China’s CCTV Channel said on its Facebook page that Antonov Company sold all manufacturing rights and technological documents for the super-heavy air freighter AN-225 Mriya to the China Aerospace company. It added that the first AN-225 could be produced in China as early as in 2019. Antonov’s press service dismissed these reports as untrue. In May, Antonov’s deputy head said that Ukraine had been considering launching joint manufacturing production with China and was planning to invite Chinese investors to the project. On Wednesday, Antonov refused to make any comments on the deal and said that it will publish additional information about the negotiations with the Chinese company later, after its delegation returns from Beijing. AN-225 is currently the biggest aircraft in the world, with a takeoff mass amounting to 640 tons and a working load of 250 tons. It was developed in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and was initially designed as a carrier for the Soviet Buran (Snowstorm) space shuttle.

A binary star system involves two stars which are close enough together that their gravitational movement causes them to orbit each other. Star HD 133131A hosts two planets, one of which is at least 1.5 times Jupiter’s mass, while the other is at least half Jupiter’s mass. Astronomers have found several planets in recent years that are very different from those in our solar system. The most-common exoplanets detected are so-called ‘super-Earths’ which are larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune or Uranus. READ MORE: Home from home: Scientists may have discovered an Earth-like planet with water But exoplanets the size of those found orbiting HD 133131A and HD 133131B are very rare, according to NASA, and have only been detected around a small number of stars. The stars, HD 133131A and HD 133131B, are extremely close together - particularly considering they are orbited by such massive planets - sitting 360 astronomical units (AU) apart. One AU is equal to the distance between the Earth and the sun (nearly 150 million kilometers). ‘Proxima b’ move-in ready? Closest ever Earth-like planet confirmed by scientists https://t.co/O0tXHSw11Lpic.twitter.com/C8j4YjytqO The next-closest binary system that hosts planets is comprised of two stars that are about 1,000 AU’s apart. Researchers said this kind of system is incredibly rare, and the latest discovery makes it one of only seven ever found. The researchers point out that this system is even more unusual because both stars are “metal poor,” meaning that most of their mass is hydrogen and helium, as opposed to other elements such as iron or oxygen. Usually, stars that host giant planets are \"metal rich.” Researchers say Jupiter’s gravitational pull is likely to have significantly influenced the shape of our solar system as it was forming, and the scarcity of Jupiter-like planets could be key in explaining why our system is different from all the others found to date. The findings, which may help explain the influence that giant planets have over a solar system’s architecture, have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Johanna Teske, who led the research, explained: “We are trying to figure out if giant planets like Jupiter often have long and, or eccentric orbits.” “If this is the case, it would be an important clue to figuring out the process by which our solar system formed, and might help us understand where habitable planets are likely to be found,” she added.

If Britain wished to stay relevant, he argued, it must remain bound to Europe. He said smaller countries which have population of below 100 million would be wise to rely on their “geographical relationships” to stay ahead of the game and a major part if this involves a pan-European defense force. “I would argue that in the medium term, there will be a growing requirement for Europe to build defense capability. “That force would not supplant NATO but would have the independent ability to take military action at times when Europe’s security interests are threatened when the US may decide not to be involved,” he said. Euroskeptics were quick to fire back at Blair. “If you look at other parts of the EU, they soon become bloated, unwieldy and heavily bureaucratic institutions and I have little doubt that an EU army would go the same way,” UK Independence Party (UKIP) defense spokesman Mike Hookem told the Express newspaper. Tony Blair, who is hugely responsible for so much death and chaos with his warmongering, calls for an EU army. Typical! Hookem also took a swipe at Blair’s arguably checkered record on military strategy. “At the moment we are still waiting for the results of the multimillion-pound Chilcot inquiry that has taken years to produce. “Until its release I would advise Mr. Blair to keep his own council on military matters,” he said.

Meanwhile, Norway's current non-fictional security\\xa0review lists Russia as one of the main threats. NATO officials, however, claim there's no connection. RT: It’s one of the largest exercises of its kind that comes with US deployment of strategic bombers, but NATO says it bears no relation to Russia. What do you make of that? Dan Glazebrook: You have to look at the recent history of US militarism and NATO aggression. NATO deeply invested in regime change operations by proxy, several of which have not gone very well, for example, in Syria and Ukraine. NATO has failed to ensure its new kind of regime change operations have been successful…It doesn’t want to see them fail and one of the reasons that they have been failing is because of Russia’s refusal to simply roll over and let the US create one failed state after another. So, Russia is deeply despised by many elements within the US military establishment for being a thorn in the side of the US regime change juggernaut. We have to understand that the NATO countries and the US are already leading an economic war against Russia through sanctions, through its policy to encourage Saudi to cause a debt in the oil price. This hasn’t worked. And this is resorting to outright militarism and this is part of it. And we have seen NATO member Turkey attacking and shooting down a Russian jet and we’ve seen in the last few weeks Turkey and Saudi Arabia opening an invasion of Syria…This is part of the ongoing attempts to show the world that the US is ready, able and willing to fight a world war - potentially with Russia.\\xa0 Not just to fight against Syria or Libya, but actually to risk world war against Russia to defend its right to conduct illegal regime change, to create failed states and to turn peaceful countries into sectarian bloodbaths. That is what this is all about. RT: The war games include an aggressor part and a defender part. Do you think there is a strategic undertone or it’s just a way for NATO to demonstrate its military power? DG: There are strategic elements. There is going to be strategic resource wars in the Arctic and they are preparing for that... Remember the US strategy of full-spectrum dominance announced after the end of the Cold war: the idea that there should be no inch of the planet really that is beyond US military control…But I still think first and foremost they need to convince the world, demonstrate to the world that they are willing to go to war with Russia. Because it may be a bluff, but they need to convince the world that this is not a bluff and that they are able to do that. And for sure there are elements in the US military establishment [who] would be willing to do that, and that is not a bluff. So, it is a very dangerous situation that we are seeing develop here. RT: NATO says that there are no grounds for Russia to consider these drills and the whole NATO activity in the region as a threat. Do you think these claims are true? DG: These countries often have this kind of analysis, but have mater on its head. Who’s going around the world creating failed states. If we look at Russia’s actions, they have been defensive and as much as they’ve been trying to defend, for example, in Ukraine, and actually quite minimal involvement of Russia in Ukraine, but to the extent they have been involved to try and defend the people of eastern Ukraine from the onslaught of neo-Nazi forces that have been unleashed on them by an illegal regime change operation backed by the US. In Syria they have been invited by the Syrian government to prevent a collapse of the Syrian government in the face of a sectarian death squad onslaught sponsored by the US and Britain and others.\\xa0 To try and characterize this as Russian aggression when actually they are just conducting some level of defense against illegal aggression that has been going on around the world led by the US, this is completely puts the matter on its head. It’s an observable, empirical fact that NATO is surrounding and encircling Russia with troops, threatening Russia with this kind of exercises. We also know from past experience that NATO countries’ leaders are not to be believed when they reassure Russia. For example, when George Bush Sr said that NATO won’t advance one inch to the East, and every country that has joined the EU to the East had subsequently gone on to join NATO.

Gen. Yahya Rasool said in a statement cited by AP. Most of the bodies have been reduced to skeletons. Due to the decaying process of the bodies as well as their clothes it’ is hard to establish whether these were soldiers or civilians, Rasool added. A forensics team from Baghdad is set to investigate the site and carry out tests on the bodies. Islamic State terrorists and all those involved in the atrocities in Mosul should be hold responsible, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said following the news about the latest mass grave. “The only thing we can do is condemn these atrocities. We hope that the military operation will be over soon and that it would go in accordance with international law, human rights and international humanitarian law so that people could get their lives back to normal. There is no doubt that those who commit these inhuman crimes should be held accountable,” Dujarric said, adding that the UN is highly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Mosul. In June, Iraqi troops found another mass grave with the remains of nearly 400 people by the city of Fallujah while leading an operation against IS. Most of the victims there were executed in 2014 and 2015 with a shot in the head. Mosul, the IS stronghold in Iraq, is under siege by several forces, including the Iraqi army, its allies from the Shiite militias, Kurdish militias, and a Turkish expeditionary force in Iraq. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the joint offensive. The current events resemble a “medieval slaughter” as the population is being killed by both IS terrorists and the US-led coalition conducting operations in Mosul, according to spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sunday that 34,000 Iraqis had left their homes since the start of the operation, adding that most of those people were put in temporary shelters. However, over 1 million civilians are believed to remain trapped in Mosul as the terrorists kill anybody who attempts to flee. While the offensive in Iraq’s second most populous has not yet entered the intensive urban warfare phase, international humanitarian organizations have voiced concern that the hostilities will take a significant toll on the civilian population.

This is war and there is no other choice than to fight it.”  Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Front party, has blamed the church attack not only on Islamists, but also on those “who have governed this country over the past 30 years,” saying they bear “huge” responsibility for the current events.Philippe de Villers, a former two-time French presidential candidate and leader of the Movement for France (MPF), a conservative party, told RT that the attackers’ choice of target was significant “and represents something completely new.”“Before they used to attack the police, passers-by or those on holiday – now they are targeting those who are religious,” he said, while also saying the country’s “soul” had been affected. “France was cut to the heart, its soul is weeping,” he said, adding that the attack “marked a new stage” in terrorism and that a response must now be “immediate.” “France’s borders should be restored, the flow of migrants stopped and [those who are already in the country] must be made to respect the principle of assimilation – either you love France, or leave,” he told RT.Eric Ciotti, a member of the French National Assembly from the Republicans party, has also proposed extreme measures, saying that “France must immediately expel all foreign radicals.” La France doit expulser immédiatement tous les étrangers radicalisés #SaintEtienneDuRouvray 3/4 Other politicians expressed concern over the precedence punishing measures take over precautionary ones. A former interior ministry official, Yvan Blot, told RT he believes France needs to upgrade its intelligence services, saying that “only the secret services are efficient,” while also accusing the government of not taking the threat posed by Islamic extremists seriously. “It is not very efficient to display lots of police or soldiers on the street. Naturally this is good for the morale of the local population, but efficiency comes only from the secret services,” he said.

And the threat of terror at the moment remains severe. And I don’t buy into any of the arguments why staying in Europe is a good idea when we can’t control our borders, the threat of terror is severe and we are giving over 350 million pounds a day to an institution when our own NHS is bankrupt.

In one case, a 27-year-old migrant was arrested for a sexual attack on two nine-year-old girls at a swimming pool in the town of Rendsburg in April. Back then, the girls told police that they were inappropriately touched by two foreigners at the local swimming pool. However, law enforcers managed to detain only one of the attackers – a 27-year-old Iraqi man. Similar cases have also been reported from Austria. Earlier this week an Iraqi refugee who raped a 10-year-old boy at a Vienna swimming pool in December 2015 saw his conviction overturned due to a “formal mistake.” ']\n",
            "['13 Dec, 2016 16:02 ', 'Can test for 3-year-olds predict who’ll end up in jail or on drugs?', 'uk', 'The simple test, developed by researchers at King’s College London, takes 45 minutes and gauges children’s intelligence, language and motor skills, as well as their levels of tolerance, restlessness, impulsivity and social disadvantage. Three-year-olds who score the lowest results are more likely to receive criminal convictions or end up relying on welfare benefits. Scientists followed 1,000 children from before they started school until they were adults aged 38, to see if it was possible to predict who would end up having a troubled life. Forcing children to attend Christian school assemblies undermines human rights - UN https://t.co/FeboRuMDFQpic.twitter.com/9IrPb4TP4R After 35 years, researchers found 20 percent of the 1,000 children became a much greater drain on society than the other 80 percent. One fifth of the group was responsible for 81 percent of the criminal convictions, three quarters of drug prescriptions, two thirds of welfare benefits payments and more than half of nights in hospital. This finding confirmed to researchers that the ‘Pareto principle’ – which states that for many events, 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes – can also be applied to human behavior. “About 20 percent of the population is using the lion’s share of a wide array of public services,” said Professor Terrie Moffitt of King’s College and Duke University in North Carolina. “The same people use most of the NHS (National Health Service), the criminal courts, insurance claims for disabling injury, pharmaceutical prescriptions and special welfare benefits.” Police break up mass children’s brawl in southeast London https://t.co/0KYMVviETYpic.twitter.com/EK5QkNPY4I Researchers also learned this outcome can be predicted simply by looking at how well the participants scored on the test they were given at age three. They hope to use the test to determine who is at greater risk, so that interventions can be made to prevent them becoming a burden on society. Moffitt said it is easy to think of these people as “lazy bums who are freeloading off the taxpayer and exploiting the public purse.” “But we also went further back into their childhood and found that 20 percent begin their lives with mild problems with brain function and brain health when they were very small children. Looking at health examinations really changed the whole picture. It gives you a feeling of compassion for these people as opposed to a feeling of blame. “Being able to predict which children will struggle is an opportunity to intervene in their lives very early to attempt to change their trajectories for everyone’s benefit, and could bring big returns on investment for government.” ']\n",

While UK-Russia bilateral relations are not at their highest, at least, this does not prevent intense artistic exchange between the two countries as people feel connection on the cultural level regardless of political tension, Fiennes said. “Well, already, the great theater director Declan Donnellan for many years has been creating fantastic productions in Moscow with Russian actors and I know the Russian theater that often comes to London,” he said, citing an example of such an exchange, adding that he is “happy [the theater] continues to do so.” “Whatever happens politically, in terms of our culture and our understanding through music, drama, painting we have a deep connection,” he concluded. Ralph Fiennes is best known for his performance as Nazi war criminal Amon Göth in Schindler's List, which garnered him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well as in The English Patient, The Avengers and other word-famous productions. The Harry Potter saga fans, however, know him as Lord Voldemort. The fifth St. Petersburg International Culture Forum, which serves an international platform for open dialog and exchange of opinion between experts in culture and cultural policy, is being held from December 1-3. The forum has been organized by the Russian government, the St. Petersburg authorities and endorsed by the Russian Culture Ministry. The extensive program of the forum has been divided into 14 sections, each devoted to one specific cultural field, such as cinema, theater, music, tourism, literature, mass communications, cultural heritage preservation, creative industry and urban science. The number of IMAX theaters in Russia has surpassed that in the UK and trails only China and US, IMAX Senior Vice President John Schreiner told RT speaking at the sidelines of the forum, which this time marks the last month of the Russia’s Year of Film. “Russia is the No. 3 market for us in terms of number of theaters,” Schreiner said, adding that three new IMAX theaters – in Irkutsk, Lipetsk and Tula – will be opened in the coming week. IMAX expansion in Russia has been going at a tremendous pace lately and while it may not be the case anymore, Shreiner hopes the trend will be upward despite the economic problems the company had to deal with in Russia after the ruble plunged against the dollar two years ago. “We expected it continue to grow maybe not as a breakneck pace as we had in the last few years but at the regular pace, about five or six new IMAX theaters in Russia,” Shreiner said. IMAX has been hugely investing in developing new sort “out-of-home entertainment” technologies. Last year the company finished its largest R&D program to date, a laser projection technology, as well as invested in virtual reality. “To support Russia’s Year of Film, IMAX has stepped up its work with Russian home-grown directors and producers like Alexander Rodnyansky, Fedor Bondarchuk and Leonard Vereschagin,” Shreiner noted, saying that the company has remastered them in IMAX format to bring to new viewers abroad, including to China. \"]\n",

We collected information on this as early as 2014, when we received many reports of people being shot when they were trying to cross the border irregularly,” Gardner said. He added that the current situation in war-torn Syria has led to a spike in the number of migrants being assaulted by Turkish border guards. “Now, the information we received via Syria doctors is that there are reports of two or three people being shot every day trying to cross the border irregularly,” he said. The researcher also stated that the plight of refugees in Syria has driven many of them into the “hands of smugglers,” or forced them to cross the border at night. According to Gardner, Turkish guards fire shots at refugees based on what they say are safety measures. “What the Turkish parties have told us is that they don’t know who these people are, that people could be members of armed groups, they could be smugglers,” he said. Gardner added that the only way to resolve the problem of the migrant flow was to make legal crossing points for refugees on the border with Turkey, and said Ankara “should not have to hold the responsibility for hosting refugees alone.” To alleviate the issue, the researcher urged EU members to accept bigger migrant quotas and advised Russia to accept more refugees from neighboring countries. Late on Monday, Turkey and the EU struck a “game-changing” deal on resolving the refugee crisis in Europe. EU leaders agreed in principle to an Ankara-proposed plan to deport illegal migrants from Greece to Turkey while resettling the same number of Syrian refugees in the EU. In return, EU leaders promised Ankara an additional €3 billion (US$3.3 billion), hinting that further funding, as well as a speedy decision on a visa-free regime, could be expected. Ankara was reminded, however, that it would have to observe all 72 requirements to enjoy such a regime. Turkey has stepped up its border security amid pressure from the US, following the November terror attacks in Paris. The US urged Ankara to close its border with Syria to halt the number of fighters seeking to join terrorist groups fighting there. Damascus has accused Ankara of facilitating the cross-border movement of jihadists, while Moscow has directly accused the family of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of backing the illegal oil trade with Islamic State (IS, ISIS/ISIL) that involves Syrian and Iraqi oil being smuggling across the Turkish border.

He was extremely tired and admits to falling asleep at the wheel, according to KFOX. \\'Quiet hero\\': Photo of cop feeding baby after mom’s seizure melts hearts online http://t.co/pRDz8Unmbypic.twitter.com/QZgPvQcNoK “I stopped at the Circle K just up the street. I don\\'t remember what I put. To this day, I don\\'t remember what I put. I had to check my bank account,” Ortega told KFOX. Ortega doesn\\'t remember anything after that except waking up at University Medical Center. But he does take issue with police accounts of the incident, so he turned to local media for an interview and investigation. “I had some bruises on my face and I could feel it when making [facial] gestures,” Ortega said, but he and his family are sure his worst injuries aren’t a result of a car accident. There were also bruises on Ortega’s arms, legs, feet, and back, broken bones in one hand and two fingers, along with two Taser lacerations on his stomach, according to medical records. Additionally, records say Ortega had a grand mal seizure while in his car. That explains certain details in the police report, Ortega and his mother say. The police accident report describes officers responding at 12:45 a.m. to Ortega doing \"donuts,\" or spinning his car until it rammed a rock wall. During or immediately after that moment is when Ortega is believed to have suffered a seizure, which police allegedly unknowingly witnessed. “When he comes out of [a seizure], that\\'s when he\\'s like walking around like in a state of confusion,” Olaya Calanche, Ortega’s mother, told KFOX. “I\\'ve talked to him and I\\'ll be like ‘Junior, Junior, it\\'s Mom.’ He’ll look at me but like he looks past me.\" Police assumed Ortega was drunk, charging him with DUI despite a hospital toxicology report showing no drugs or alcohol in his system. About a week later, the district attorney dropped that charge. However, Ortega still faces charges of resisting arrest, evading arrest, and interfering with public duties. He is now trying to find a lawyer. With police withholding some information pending their internal investigation, Calanche relied on a nurse from the hospital for more details. The nurse spoke with the paramedics who treated her son in an ambulance accompanied by a police officer. The nurse, according to Calanche, was told by paramedics that “my son had become very combative and he had become so strong like the Incredible Hulk that they had to [Taser] him twice and used a baton and some of the bruises were because of the baton.” The first of three arresting affidavits described Ortega “looking around aimlessly” and that he “appeared disoriented,” saying he needed to leave. Ortega began walking away from the responding officer, and that’s when the first arrest attempt was made. The affidavit continues, saying Ortega grabbed the officer by \"his arms and forced him to the ground,\" before Ortega wrestled out of that and the officer pinned him against the rock wall. Still trying to apply the handcuffs, the officer called for backup, then used his Taser three times, at which point the wires tangled and the officer switched to his baton. While the second affidavit concurs with the first, saying three officers were needed to take control of Ortega, the third affidavit actually doubled that figure, claiming six officers were required. The affidavits allege Ortega was “tensing his arms, thrashing his legs and twisting his body,”\\xa0but that wasn’t a sign of resistance, according to Ortega’s physician, KFOX reported. Neverclear: Student gets stuck on tracks, wrestles cops after drinking high-proof alcohol https://t.co/lQH0JE9M7gpic.twitter.com/z7tzwQlcTm “If a person does not know what a seizure is, they will not know this is a seizure,” said Dr. Darine Kassar, a neurologist at Texas Tech University Health Science Center. After the seizure, the person goes into what is called a \"postictal phase,\" which can last minutes or hours. “They will not know what happened, they will be confused, they will be disoriented,” Kassar said. “They can be combative, they can be not following commands, because they are confused. They are not back to their normal baseline.” In this situation, “don\\'t try to restrain them or be aggressive with them,” Kassar said, “because they are still not back to their normal selves.” Kassar also clarified that Ortega was driving because he had been seizure-free for over six months and was regularly taking his medication. Texas law requires a person have no seizures for three months before being able to drive legally. Not only was Ortega constrained and beaten, he was left face down when fire officials and paramedics arrived, a position that “can obstruct breathing and cause death,” according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Paramedics treated Ortega as a level one trauma, the most severe, KFOX reported, and Ortega was still having seizures and maintaining a postictal phase on the way to the hospital.

I\\'ll get pulled over and talk very courteously to any cop. I have cop friends.” Ortega turned himself in after being released from the hospital, but it was his injuries that kept him off of work for a month. That, Ortega fears, could be only the beginning of the consequences he will face if he is unable to get a good enough lawyer to defend himself in court. “What I am worried about is it might not work. I might still get this, I might not have enough evidence and the judge will return it and say, ‘Hey, you\\'re going to have this on your record.’ That\\'s what worries me,” Ortega told KFOX.

The agents allegedly asked Bout if it was possible for members of a foreign terrorist group to purchase anti-aircraft weapons, and he reportedly answered that it could be possible, in theory, but without ever offering to provide them. This admission of theoretical possibility was apparently sufficient for the United States to extradite Bout to the United States in 2010, however, and a year later he was convicted of being involved in a conspiracy to kill US citizens. He pleaded not guilty in court and continues to insist on his innocence. Russia has repeatedly blasted Bout’s extradition and sentence as a politically motivated violation of international law and an example of the bias of the US justice system. In a 2016 interview with the New York Times, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin admitted that the charges brought against Bout were excessive and inappropriate. “I’m not defending him,” Scheindlin said, “but he’s a businessman.

BBC to erect George Orwell statue outside London HQ', 'uk', 'The statue of Orwell – real name Eric Blair – will be accompanied by a plaque that reads: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear,” the Guardian reported on Monday. Sculptor Martin Jennings told the Guardian: “I was delighted when I visited the site to find it littered with cigarette butts – that is absolutely the place for Orwell, who was rarely seen without a cigarette in hand, to the grave detriment of his health.” “He would undoubtedly have been out there in the cold with the smokers for most of his time,” Jennings added. ‘1984’, perhaps Orwell’s most famous work, tells the story of an unfortunate everyman making his way through a fictional authoritarian Britain locked in an everlasting war against an indistinct enemy. In the dystopian scenario, civil liberties are eliminated and the citizenry constantly watched as they are fed lies by a shadowy government organization called the Ministry of Truth. Plans to erect a statue to Orwell were dropped in 2012, allegedly because the Spanish Civil War veteran was viewed as being too left-wing. For one reason or another, the plan has been revived. Orwell himself was once employed by the BBC as a producer on the organization’s Eastern Service. The terrifying torture chamber depicted in ‘1984’ – Room 101 – was even named after a stuffy conference room in the BBC HQ to which Orwell apparently took a severe dislike. In his 1943 resignation letter, available in the BBC’s online archives, Orwell attacks the corporation’s tendency to broadcast “hopeless” propaganda on India. It was later found that the kind of radio sets the BBC broadcasted for were not widely in use in India, and that the signal was so weak it would have been unintelligible anyway. The campaign for a statue of the man, who many consider the father of political journalism, was launched by the late Labour MP Ben Whittaker. His widow Janet told the Metro newspaper on Monday: “Orwell’s resonance is international. Wherever powerful governments falsify events, suppress freedom of information or dehumanize their processes, people recognize the satire in 1984.” ']\n",

Researchers led by #UofT\\'s Barbara Sherwood Lollar find mysterious signs of life in ancient water https://t.co/jdRpgpanlz While this doesn’t definitively prove microbes are living in the water, the researchers are excited about the possibility that microbial communities have been evolving there for millions of years without either sunlight or atmospheric oxygen. \"This continues to open up our idea of how much of this planet is habitable,\" Barbara Sherwood Lollar, one of the researchers from the University of Toronto, told The Globe and Mail.\\xa0\"And it speaks to the habitability of Mars as well.\" The surface of Mars is covered with billion-year-old rocks, and some areas of the Red Planet boast a similar mineral composition to that tested in northern Ontario.\\xa0 “Because this is a fairly common geological setting in early Earth as well as modern Mars, we think that as long as the right minerals and water are present, likely kilometers below the surface, they can produce the necessary energy source to support the microbes. I’m not saying that these microbes definitively exist, but the conditions are right to support microbial life on Mars,” Li said. Researchers in South Africa had previously found microbes living in ancient water in the cracks of rocks, however the Canadian water has been isolated for 10 times longer than the South African samples. Li, whose team is now working with microbiologists to establish any traces of life in the water, says the best bet of finding life on Mars is to look beneath the surface. via GIPHY The findings have also sparked excitement in scientific circles beyond those directly involved in the research. Alex Sessions, professor of geobiology at Caltech, told the Globe and Mail that the development was significant. “The thing that’s special is that the sulfate is being generated by radioactive decay,” Sessions explained. “It means that on countless planets, moons or asteroids that lack oceans, volcanoes and deep sea vents – all of which help support ecosystems on Earth – alien life may be surviving on little more than water, sulfur and radioactive elements.” ']\n",

The tender for this procedure has not yet been announced.” According to the data published by the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom, the sub’s disarmament is estimated to cost some 28 million rubles (about US$ 400,000). The nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine Arkhangelsk TK-17 was designed in 1987 under the Project 941 ‘Shark’ (or ‘Typhoon’ according to NATO classification). The project was aimed to equip the Soviet Navy with nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and resulted in the creation of the largest class of submarines ever built – large enough to accommodate decent living facilities for the crew of 179 when submerged for months on end, and to stock an arsenal of 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Three of the six Typhoon-class submarines built in the 1980s have already been dismantled at the shipyards in Severodvinsk. Of the three that remain, Arkhangelsk and Severstal are set to be dismantled. Dmitri Donskoi just recently underwent a modernization procedure and is now equipped to test the latest sea-based missile system Bulava. The New START treaty (on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms), which was designed to reduce American and Russian nuclear stockpiles, came into force in 2011. It replaced the previous 1991 agreement, introducing lower ceilings for the numbers of warheads and delivery systems deployed. Commenting on the progress made on the treaty’s fifth anniversary in February, US Secretary of State John Kerry complimented both sides on successful cooperation in the field. “[New START treaty] continues to be an area of cooperation and continued dialogue between the United States and Russia. I share President Obama's strong belief that our two countries, which ushered in the era of nuclear arms, have a special responsibility to lead the world beyond it,”\\xa0he said in a statement.\\xa0 However, the latest moves by the US – such as plans to upgrade 180 B61s strategic bombs stocked in European air bases to a modernized B61-12 version – have raised doubts whether the US adheres to the nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Opponents of the program have argued that instead of scaling down atomic weapons stockpiles in accordance with the NPT, the overhaul is actually creating more states hosting modern nuclear weapons – a provocation that theoretically weakens Russia’s deterrent. Moscow keeps the presence of American nuclear weapons in Europe in mind when shaping its own military policies. as reflected in Russia’s newest military doctrine published in 2014, spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova told German television last year. “The comprehensive analysis of the situation points to the threat posed by the increasing military capability of NATO and its endowment with global functions, which it performs in violation of the international law, as well as the encroachment of the military infrastructure of NATO members on the borders of the Russian Federation,” she said.

            "['14 Feb, 2016 11:06 ', 'EXCLUSIVE: Robin Hood neuroscientist behind Sci-Hub research-pirate site talks to RT', 'news', '“There should be no obstacles to accessing knowledge, I believe,” she told RT in an email interview, echoing her earlier reference to Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: that “everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.” Whether you’re a young Master’s student, an ambitious postdoctoral researcher or a seasoned professor, you rely on other people’s research to supplement your own as a lifeline. But it has become so that while the scientists writing the papers are paid next to nothing, they are essentially faced with a middleman in the form of money-hoarding online publishers – academic hubs where all that research resides, sometimes costing $30 per paper to download. Now, imagine having to download at least 10-20 such papers – and that is for a scarcely popular topic. Researchers may have to go through dozens for other ones. Elbakyan, a Russian neuroscientist from Kazakhstan, was among the many victims of this academic capitalist monopoly on knowledge. Writing her thesis on the lesser-researched areas of biometric scanning for consumer electronics, she was faced with $300 at the very least for papers she would probably never again have to read. “For me, even the purchase of one such article would be a financial setback,” Alexandra told RT in an email. “So I had to go about acquiring all the articles by pirate means.” A year or two after 2009, when Alexandra took part in a large online forum on molecular biology, she was introduced to Fulltext – a hub where researchers could file requests for academic papers to help with research. Already an expert coder, it did not take Alexandra long to write her own, improved script a year later. Called Sci-Hub, it circumvents university server security using access keys provided by sympathetic researchers with online resource access at those universities. Every time there was a search, Sci-Hub would locate the work, and it was on its servers forever. Now the portal boasts close to 50 million papers and growing. If before, it was a mere search and extraction tool, it now automatically searches for missing articles on important topics, and downloads them to its database. “In the end the system got to its feet and started self-adding up to a million articles each month,” Alexandra says. Akin to an anonymizer website, it looks for the link and, using university proxies, sends it back to the student unlocked. “That the original anonymizer codes were open-source was a huge blessing. But university proxies function slightly differently, so I had to alter the source code,” Alexandra says. “The entire development, including testing, took only about three days,” she says. “I was surprised myself that the thing actually worked and people were using it… the ‘thank you’ button was clicked 316 times as soon as the service was announced.” Other scientists on the microbiology forum became the site’s first users. There were one or two other portals dealing with such requests, (Library Genesis, or Lib-Gen, remains the only one similar to Sci-Hub), but with only 100 requests per day at the start, Sci-Hub now gets anywhere from one to several thousand. Having undergone some minor and major rewrites over the four years, Alexandra’s website really is the best viable alternative to paid sources today. Unsurprisingly, this quickly increased its capacity for interfering with huge payoffs enjoyed by science publishers – sources that basically make scientists buy back their work. This infamy led to popular scientific publisher Elsevier filing a lawsuit, which was successful late last year in getting a temporary injunction against Sci-Hub’s activities. This was after in 2012, a large community of scientists boycotted it; so much so that even Harvard University complained it didn’t have enough funds to keep paying Elsevier. The publisher estimated its losses to be in the area of $75,000-150,000, court records stated. It now wants this figure paid out for each and every pirated article. There are hundreds of thousands. Its reasoning is that monetizing access to academic knowledge helps bring in funding for academic research. But Elbakyan and others say most study authors don’t actually get paid for published work – and that is why Sci-Hub is so different from some illegal music or movie download service. Currently, Elbakayn says she’s been served with a temporary injunction. It could still go either way for Sci-Hub, but it is unlikely that a US court would rule in favor of free information, she believes. READ MORE: Climate change helps slow, not quicken, rising sea levels – NASA Either way, American courts can’t really cause much more damage to Sci-Hub than ruling in Elsevier’s favor. Firstly, because Sci-Hub servers are outside the US, in Russia. The New York district court can’t prosecute Elbakyan, because she has no US assets; secondly, because an ever-growing body of scientists actually support the initiative and increasingly turn against the capitalizing publishers; and third – because even if someone tried to target Sci-Hub, they couldn’t: its servers have moved to the dark net– that concealed corner of the internet normally reserved for buying drugs, ordering hits on people or trading in child pornography. “Even if legal access to [Sci-Hub] is blocked, the user can still get in through the TOR network and immediately gain access to all the articles. However, we intent to fight for free access to all information. After all, using TOR still provides obstacles. And I believe there should be no obstacles on the way to scientific knowledge.” After Elsevier’s court victory last year, many scientists who had already previously boycotted the publisher wrote an open letter in support of Sci-Hub and the Netherlands-based Library Genesis. “There are many businessmen who own knowledge today. Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose 37 percent profit margin stands in sharp contrast to the rising fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages for the adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest databases of academic material, which are licensed at prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest university of the global north, has complained that it cannot afford them any longer,” it writes. The scientists called Elsevier’s lawsuit “a big blow” and described how online forums, IRC channels and chatrooms “have been filled with [academics’] distress messages, desperately seeking articles and publications.” But Elbakyan herself refuses to give up, despite the mounting risks of picking a fight with the establishment. And she says that, as long as such overwhelming support from fellow scientists continues, her idea has a fighting chance. It already appears to be changing the entire approach to knowledge-gathering and challenging the capitalistic greed that seeks to privatize it. ']\n",

They show that secretive NSA kill-capture operations in the Middle East have been developed and initiated from inside the base’s heavily guarded perimeter wire. The programs, which carry names like GHOSTWOLF and GHOSTHUNTER, have been used to support conventional operations in war zones such as Afghanistan and Yemen – with which neither Britain nor the US is officially at war. In July, the Obama administration revealed that somewhere between 64 and 116 civilian casualties were inflicted by US air strikes outside Afghanistan and Iraq in the years 2009 through 2015. While Washington didn’t specify where exactly the deadly strikes took place, they are believed to have been carried out in Yemen, Pakistan and North Africa. But the release of the figures, touted by Obama as a step toward more transparency, was criticized by various human rights organizations as distorting the actual picture. According to various independent assessments, anywhere from 200 up to 1,000 civilians fell victim to the US air campaigns. The leaks also call into question claims about UK complicity in deadly drones strikes carried out using the intelligence base. In the past Britain claims to have full knowledge and have given full consent for what goes on at Menwith Hill, despite claims by campaigners that clandestine US operations may constitute war crimes. The latest revelations have been criticized by human rights groups, including Reprieve. The organization’s top lawyer, Kat Craig, told the Intercept on Tuesday this was “yet another example of the unacceptable level of secrecy that surrounds UK involvement in the US ‘targeted killing’ program.” “It is now imperative that the prime minister comes clean about UK involvement in targeted killing to ensure that British personnel and resources are not implicated in illegal and immoral activities,” Craig said. While the Ministry of Defence (MoD) refused to comment on the release, an approach by the Intercept to the NSA was referred to Director of National Intelligence (DNI). DNI spokesman Richard Kolko told the website: “The men and women serving the intelligence community safeguard US national security by collecting information, conducting analysis, and providing intelligence for informed decision making under a strict set of laws, policies and guidelines. This mission protects our nation and others around the world.” In April 2012, the covert Menwith Hill intelligence center was propelled into the public spotlight after local residents joined by the members of the Occupy movement. Together, they staged mass protests outside the base.\\xa0 \"The UK’s providing a facility here that’s involved in drone attacks that we know, from independent assessments, are killing and injuring thousands of civilians, and because of the covert nature of that warfare, it’s very difficult to provide information and accountability through the UK parliament. And yet these are acts of war,” Dr Steve Schofield, author of the 65-page report \"Lifting the Lid on Menwith\", told RT back then. Matteo Bergamini, founder, director of Shout Out UK platform, believes the UK government should give an explicit account to the public on what is actually going on in the clandestine facility. “Ideally, I would like the authorities to come clean, to say what has happened and essentially put it to the public and actually start to act\\xa0like a democracy,” he told RT, adding that those people who will be found responsible of violating the international law as result of such revelations, should be prosecuted in the UK. However, the chances of this taking place are low, judging by past experience. “I think the reaction of the authorities will be trying to hide it, or trying to scapegoat it on somebody else like they had with the whistleblowers in the past,” Bergamini said.

The post, written by BBC producer Andrew Alexander, is alleged to have said: “Just before 9am we learned from Laura Kuenssberg, who comes on the program every Wednesday ahead of PMQs, that she was speaking to one junior shadow minister who was considering resigning. “I wonder, mused our presenter Andrew Neil, if they would consider doing it live on the show?” The proposition was then put to Kuenssberg, who though it a “great idea.” How the BBC fixed the news on Wednesday.

I should be here. I deserve to be here. Their fall could have been mine,” the pontiff says. “The Church does not exist to condemn people, but to bring about an encounter with the visceral love of God’s mercy,\" he says. “I often say that in order for this to happen, it is necessary to go out: to go out from the churches and the parishes, to go outside and look for people where they live, where they suffer, and where they hope.\" In his new book, Pope Francis, who has called for the Church to extend a helping hand to people on the margins of society, reprimands those in the organization \"who are only used to having things fit into their pre-conceived notions and ritual purity instead of letting themselves be surprised by reality, by a greater love or a higher standard.\" In his first book published as Pope, he says he also wants the Church to show more compassion towards homosexuals.

Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church and are banned from receiving communion seek mercy too, the pontiff noted. \"We need to enter the darkness, the night in which so many of our brothers live.

JJ: The first thing that occurred to me – that was August of 2014, over a year after she left the State Department – my first thought was: “She just didn’t discover that day the Saudis and the Qataris are supporting ISIS. When did she know that, when did she formulate this absolutely absurd policy?” RT:\\xa0Clearly she was formulating policy with her staff knowing that she was going to run for president. But she didn’t announce until a year later. What insight do these e-mails give us on what kind of president she would be and what kind of foreign policy she would advocate? JJ: One thing I noticed, by the way, she says “pressure the Saudis,” but she doesn’t say pressure to do exactly what? She doesn’t say in so many words: “Make them stop supporting ISIS,” and … she’s got a lot of money in the foundation from these people. So I think she will continue to trade carefully with governments we know are supporting terrorists. She would continue to have an unrealistic policy about where we want to go with this. But the bottom line with her will be belligerence - “Attack Assad, let’s get into this war.” RT:\\xa0There is a school of thought that Assad will never give up power as long as the Russians are allies. Where does that leave the US? Is it at a crossroads of making a decision? JJ: I think we [the US] are. The Obama administration I believe just simply wants to keep it simmering until Hillary – President Obama hopes – takes office. He wants Assad out for what reason? Because we said so. It really boils down to that. That was the position we took – this whole mythology of the Arab Spring; that this is all caused by the oppressive government. And it is not in the real world.

            "['13 Dec, 2016 16:12 ', 'Putin’s ‘no-nonsense’ dog causes commotion at interview with Japanese media (VIDEO)', 'news', 'Yume was given to the Russian president by the governor of Japan’s Akita prefecture as a three-month-old puppy four years ago, in a symbolic gesture of gratitude to Russia for its help following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. On Tuesday, Putin was scheduled to give an interview to Nippon TV and Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper ahead of a landmark visit to Japan, and the Kremlin said that the journalists requested to check up on how well the dog was doing in her new homeland. Putin obliged, and brought Yume to the pre-interview photo-call – but this is where things went rapidly off-script. As the presidential pool cameras clicked, the dog began barking loudly and inching towards the interviewers, who stood frozen with – somewhat mortified – smiles, as the scene threatened to turn into an international incident. Putin, who was holding the leash, remained unperturbed, before pulling out dog treats from the pocket of his business suit. This seemed to have the desired effect, with Yume eating out of Putin’s palm and rising on her hind legs, to the delight of the press pack. The dog was then led away so the interview could commence. “I was told that you wanted to see my dog, Yume. You can see that she is in great shape,” began Putin. Yomiuri Shimbun Managing Editor Takeshi Mizoguchi admitted that he was “surprised” and “scared” by the dog. “You were right to take caution, Yume is a no-nonsense dog. There are many people here, with camcorders running, lights shining, and cameras clicking. She is being a guard dog,” explained the Russian president. The dog was in a similarly uncooperative mood in 2014, when she was brought out to meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, during crucial trade talks in Sochi. Photos from the meeting show Putin petting the animal, while Abe keeps a respectful distance. The Russian leader admitted afterwards that Yume is prone to biting. Prior to the visit, Japan revealed that it wanted to gift a “bridegroom” to Yume, another pedigree Akita, but the Kremlin refused. Neither side gave an explanation for the reason. It is possible that the Kremlin was wary of adding another member of the famously independent-minded and protective breed to its kennels, or perhaps it wanted to avoid devaluing a diplomatic gesture. Vladimir Putin is a well-known dog lover, and has been given multiple pups as gifts since first becoming president in 2000, including his beloved Labrador Retriever Konni, who died in 2014. Konni was involved in the most high-profile dog-related diplomatic incident of recent years, when she was accused of intimidating Angela Merkel, who has a fear of dogs, during a meeting with Putin in 2007. Putin said he had no idea about the German chancellor’s canine phobia, and apologized. ']\n",

These concerns are being confirmed today,” Senator Viktor Ozerov, who chairs the upper house’s Defense and Security Committee, told\\xa0Ria Novosi. The Russian lawmaker was referring to interceptor missile launchers deployed in Poland and Romania, which Washington insists are needed to protect Europe from a rocket attack. The vertical-launch systems are the same used on American missile cruisers to fire Tomahawk missiles. The US and Russia are both banned from having or even developing ground-based missiles with the range similar to Tomahawks by the INF Treaty signed in the late 1980s. But naval missiles are not subject to the document. Moscow says that in the event of a crisis, the US may use the ABM sites to fire Tomahawks at Russian territory. “In response to that we will be forced to beef up our air and space defense system in that direction, deploy additional forces to defend our military facilities and command centers. This includes the deployment of S-400 and Iskander systems in Kaliningrad, and the formation of new units in the Western and Southern military districts. In addition to mechanized and tank components those divisions would have units dedicated to air and space defense,” Ozerov said. The S-400 is a long-range anti-missile system used to protect strategic sites like large cities or ICBM silos from airstrikes. The Iskander is a tactical missile system capable of firing either ballistic or cruise missiles, including those carrying nuclear warheads. The Iskander system’s range is enough to reach the controversial US ABM sites. Ozerov added that Russia is developing new surface-to-air and air-to-surface missiles capable of piercing American missile shields. “It’s a dual task of overcoming the air defense systems and defending ourselves from a potential strike,” he explained. US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the deployment of S-400 and Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad was unnecessary and “destabilizing” to European security.  \"Russia has made threats to move its Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad for the past decade in response to a variety of developments in Europe, none of which demand such a military response,\" Kirby was cited as saying by Reuters.  \"We call on Russia to refrain from words or deeds that are inconsistent with the goal of promoting security and stability,\" he added.

According to the President, calls to electors to vote against president-elect Trump were “a step towards the division of the nation.” He expressed hope that American society will “draw conclusions” from this year’s race and such violations won’t repeat themselves in the next election. Putin praised Trump\\'s victory despite all odds being against the Republican candidate. “I think [Ronald] Reagan [40th US president from 1981 to 1989] would’ve been glad to see representatives of his party winning everywhere,\" he told journalists. \"And he would have been happy for the newly-elected president, who was sensitive enough to feel the moods of society and worked exactly within that paradigm, going to the very end, though nobody, except you and I believed in his victory,\" the head of state added. Putin said that Trump’s win indicates that “there is a significant gap in the definition of what is good and bad in the understanding of the elites and general public” in America. He said that the Democratic Party lost not only the presidential election, but also the vote for the House, where the Republicans have a majority, and Congress where the Republicans also have a majority. “Is this our doing too?” Putin said, referring to “the attempts of the Obama administration and the Democratic leadership to blame all their failures on external factors,” including Russian influence. The top Democratic politicians of the past, like Franklin Roosevelt, “would have surely turned in their graves” due to the current performance of their party, Putin said. “Roosevelt was a renowned figure in global and American history, who united the nation in the most difficult times, during the Great Depression of the late 1930s and World War II,” he said, adding that “the current administration is dividing it,\" he said. “This shows that there are systematic problems in the current administration,” he said.

V883 Orionis is located around 1,350 light years away from Earth and is 30 percent bigger than the Sun. “The ALMA observations came as a surprise to us,” astronomer Lucas Cieza and lead author of the report said in a statement. “Our observations were designed to image disk fragmentation, which is one of the proposed mechanisms for the formation of giant planets. “We saw none of that, as the disk is probably too warm to fragment despite its very large mass. Instead, we found what looks like a ring at 40 AU.

Julian Bray: If everything was equal they obviously should get an answer. And this whole question of 'war zones' and 'safe-height zones' has to be looked at again, because it really is a commercial decision as to whether an aircraft will actually go into a conflict zone. You are taking civilians into conflict zones and really the operators have to look at it again, because at the end of the day, it is really up to the captain of the aircraft to decide whether he is going to fly on that particular schedule. RT:\\xa0 Ukraine did not notify the European Air Traffic Organization ‘EuroControl’ about the fact that its radars hadn't been working. Why has Ukraine not been brought to account? JB: Well, you would think so. As long as you notify something that is not working, then of course you get additional assistance from the air traffic controllers because they squawk out little numbers and the numbers can be picked up so you can actually track the aircraft. But the real problem is if you got warring factions on the ground, you really need to have some kind of communication system, even if it is just a cellphone. But it has to be something. So if the civil aircraft is going over a war zone it has to be safe. And lets face it, flying over a war zone can never be safe. RT:\\xa0Why do you think the US has not handed the key information it claims to have about the shooting down of the jet to the investigators? JB: You've got to remember this is military intelligence and I can quite see why the military will be rather loathed to hand it over. They would have to hand it over in such a way that none of their secrets - because by backtracking through the software, through the images - you can actually geo-position where all of their military satellites are at any given time. So there are 101 different reasons why they won't hand it over but they have actually opened the door, because they say they have irrefutable proof, now, if they have the proof then somehow they're going to have to release it. RT:\\xa0 So realistically are we in a situation where there could actually be several parties in this investigation who have for their own self interest to hold back the information that could help the investigation. JB: Well unfortunately that is the way of the world these days. And you are talking about conflict zones, so nothing is normal. But the point is you are actually taking holiday makers and long distance air travelers through these war zones. They are not part of the war and should never be targets in the first place. And so I think the airlines have to get together and consider whether they are going to absolutely bar going through conflict zones, which I'm afraid will put the price of air travel right up.

Islamist terrorism has arrived in Germany,” Horst Seehofer, the governor of the German state of Bavaria, told reporters on Tuesday. The official gave a joint news conference with Bavaria’s interior minister, Joachim Hermann, following a summit of the local government, where security issues dominated the agenda. Last week, the country’s southern regions, including Bavaria, were shaken by four assaults, three of which were perpetrated by migrants. Officials in Germany are investigating two of the incidents as potentially linked to or inspired by Islamist extremism. Earlier, following the violence, Bavaria’s justice minister, Winfried Bausback, had also claimed that Islamist terror has “arrived in Germany,” stressing that the country should “take that into account.” During Tuesday’s press conference, Seehofer said Germany is facing\\xa0“a new dimension of terror,”\\xa0while Bavaria’s interior minister announced that the state’s police ranks would be increased. Hermann also suggested that Germany’s army (Bundeswehr) could be used to aid police in dealing with major terror threats. The debate over whether to deploy the Bundeswehr domestically should not wait\\xa0“until the next attack happens,”\\xa0he stressed, as quoted by General-Anzeiger. Lawmakers in Berlin are also discussing the possibility of establishing\\xa0“troops of reservists”\\xa0to aid police during internal crisis situations, German media outlet Bild reported, citing its own sources. In July, Germany approved its new military roadmap, the White Paper, which allows for the use of the German army inside the country in cases of large-scale terror attacks. Officials in Germany are now also pushing for greater controls and screenings for asylum seekers. “We need to know who is in our country,” Seehofer said on Tuesday, insisting that the authorities should now consider various ways dealing with refugees that commit crimes. “You have to seriously consider how such people should be treated if they violate laws or pose a threat,” he told Suddeutsche Zeitung, adding that the country cannot retreat from terror out of a sense of “prudence.” Meanwhile, Bavaria’s interior minister went a step further, suggesting that refugees lacking ID’s must be “stopped at the border,” while migrants already in the country should be re-checked. “A deportation into a war zone should not be taboo as well,” Hermann said, referring to criminal refugees. Bavaria’s governor and interior minister are now waiting for the German government to take action, stating that the\\xa0“people’s concerns”\\xa0should be addressed. Germany’s federal minister of interior, Thomas de Maiziere, tried to calm emotions following the attacks, saying that refugees\\xa0“should not be put under general suspicion.” In reaction, German MP Armin Schuster said: “We need a deportation culture,” as quoted by Stuttgarter Zeitung. “Some people get a feeling they can do whatever they want,” he added, slamming Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door policy towards migrants. In the meantime, another MP and member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party (CDU), Volker Kauder, has also advocated for deportation processes to be sped up. “Criminals should be convicted faster and, where there is a legal possibility, deported,” he said, as quoted by Die Zeit. Regulating the migrant influx was flagged as a “major task” for Germany in the latest poll conducted by market research company GFK, in which 83% of respondents said they are “concerned” by the number of refugees in Germany – double the figure from last year’s report. German officials estimate that over a million migrants entered Germany in 2015, the majority of which came from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. ']\n",

He was giving evidence to the Commons Defence Committee on its inquiry into UK military operations in Syria and Iraq. Carleton-Smith said the group is not currently being targeted in British airstrikes, but the UK is ready to act if a “direct and imminent” threat to national security emerges. He warned there is a “real danger” the group remains an “abscess in the system” and might “represent a Petri dish that becomes a threat to UK national security.” Carleton-Smith said the group, which first emerged in 2011, is a mix of fighters concentrating on the civil war in Syria and those with a wider agenda. “A significant proportion are Syrian-focused that provide a wider wrapping to those much more specifically AQ-aligned [Al-Qaeda-aligned] elements that might harbour the ambition to use Syria as a springboard for an international terrorist attack plan. “There is potentially an element of British foreign fighters associated with it.” Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there is “real momentum” behind the Iraqi offensive against IS. “Clearly progress has been made. There is a real sense of momentum now of the Iraqi and Kurdish forces advancing. That needs to be sustained,” he said. But committee head Julian Lewis questioned Fallon on the numbers of IS opposition fighters, with whom Britain is waging a military campaign in Syria, asking how many of the estimated 70,000 are “moderate” or “hardline” Islamists. “The question is whether they are moderate or Islamists. The prime minister himself admitted a significant number of the people he had been talking about are relatively hardline Islamists,” Lewis said. “We have had testimony from several witnesses who make it quite clear that the overwhelming majority of opposition forces, of opposition with people with guns, are Islamists.” Fallon responded by saying: “The test is of all these groups is are they prepared to live within a plural political settlement that can in the end be democratic and take Syria towards elections. “We can argue for a very long time about these precise definitions of what is a moderate Muslim, what is an Islamist, what is someone beyond the pale or whatever. “The political process that is now getting underway does enable us to start to ask these various groups to make their choice - whether they are prepared to work with us for a political settlement and to be part eventually of a democratic process.” Fallon also acknowledged that IS, which has already established a foothold in Libya, could seek to expand its operations internationally as it came under pressure in Syria and Iraq. “That is certainly possible that we see attacks increase elsewhere in proportion to the way that they are being diminished in their caliphate. We will have to continue to be extremely vigilant about that,” he said. ']\n",

The Turks were putting forward new demands and raised the price [of the deal] like at the bazaar,” the CSU’s secretary general, Andreas Scheuer, told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper on Wednesday. “CSU is against Turkey’s EU accession and against a full-scale visa-free regime for all Turks.”However, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told journalists on Wednesday the EU is not going to lower its demands for Turkey to be granted visa-free travel to Europe. \"We will now speed up the examination of whether the necessary requirements that Turkey must fulfill, the necessary criteria, are satisfied,\" he was quoted by Reuters as saying. \"We are ready, where appropriate, to accelerate this but there will not be any lowering of quality standards,\" he said. According to Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a visa-free regime between the EU and Turkey could be established by the end of June. French President Francois Hollande, however, said that “visa liberalization could take place in June if the criteria are respected, there are 72 [of them].” Chancellor Merkel welcomed the prospect of a visa-free regime, although she stressed that Ankara’s bid to join the EU “was not on the agenda.” The outcomes of the EU-Turkey summit were met with skepticism by some ministers in Merkel’s cabinet. “I envision the visa liberalization and accelerated talks on [Turkey’s] EU accession critically,” German Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt was quoted as saying by Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. Any visa-free regime, he said, has to come with clear rules, restrictions and controls. “Otherwise it will create a basis for a new illegal migration.” “Turkey plays ‘cat and mouse’ with us,” the vice-chairman of the CSU faction in the Bundestag, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said. Previously, the EU said it would offer Turkey €3 billion (US$3.3 billion) between now and 2018, in addition to the €3 billion it had already promised to implement the scheme last year. In return, under the deal, for every Syrian national readmitted by Turkey from Greek islands, another Syrian will be resettled from Turkey to the EU countries.

The diplomat was commenting on a proposal made by the Institute of National Remembrance – the state sponsored group founded for taking care of the archives and investigating “crimes against the Polish nation.” The institute’s president Lukasz Kaminski said in a recent press interview that he wanted to create a register of monuments installed in Poland in memory of Soviet soldiers who fought and died in this country during WWII. He proposed, however, to get rid of those not placed on actual burial sites. Kaminsky said in his view these monuments didn’t symbolize the liberation of the country from German troops, but the domination of the Communist system. He said his group would encourage local authorities to tear them down. He added that the initiative did not apply to monuments at the graves and cemeteries of Soviet soldiers, and that the Polish state would continue to take care of these sites.

Besides, such actions are a direct violation of Poland’s international obligations, fixed in the 1994 intergovernmental agreement and in the 1992 treaty between our states,” he said.

For instance, how it’s a “regional power [that] doesn’t make anything” with its “economy in tatters” which is “isolated.” He also believed for a long time that it had no immigrants – despite being the second most popular migration destination\\xa0in the world. \\xa0 This week, Obama has suddenly changed his stance. And Russia has been upgraded, in his estimation, from a puny Danny De Vito to a towering Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\xa0 He told reporters in Washington how “we think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours.”\\xa0 Now, while his new stance is a bit more accurate, not to mention sure to go down well in Moscow, it also confirms how all over the shop Obama is when it comes to understanding Russia.\\xa0 Especially if you consider what he said next. Obama criticized Donald Trump for flattery toward a Kremlin supremo, which Obama said was “unprecedented” in US politics. Completely forgetting the time when a gravely ill Franklin D. Roosevelt travelled to Tehran to meet Josef Stalin, who refused to venture to Cairo. His successor, Harry Truman, later agreed to visit Yalta for the post-World War II peace conference because the Soviet leader didn’t fancy flying. Obama also failed to remember Bill Clinton comparing Boris Yeltsin to Abraham Lincoln, back in the nineties. The high praise\\xa0was for suppressing the Chechen rebellion. This later became a bad thing when Putin inherited Yeltsin’s conflict and implemented much the same policies, just more successfully. Because in American eyes, Putin is bad, whereas Yeltsin could do little wrong. Of course, Russians – who were directly affected by both leaders’ choices – tend to take a completely opposite view of the two presidents’ record in office.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Obama (falsely) appoints Putin as KGB chief in frantic attack on Trump Anyway, back to Obama’s direct comments on Russia’s status. His “regional power” assertion always seemed ludicrous in light of his own engagement with it. After all, if Russia were truly restricted to its own hinterland, why negotiate together on Syria? Not to mention Iran, where the Moscow-aided atomic deal is widely considered the current administration’s finest foreign policy achievement. Plus, how comical anyway was referring to owner of the planet’s pre-eminent nuclear arsenal as a local actor? Then there’s the idea of Russia not making anything. Where does Obama think they got all those weapons we see on display in Syria? Or did the President ever manage to explain how American astronauts get to the International Space Station these days? Because even schoolchildren know that they hitch a ride on Russia’s Soyuz craft.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Neither Clinton nor Trump likely Putin preferences for White House Perhaps Obama thought the Russians were buying this equipment, but that wouldn’t tally with the notion of how the economy is “in tatters.” Which was nonsense anyway, because according to IMF estimates for 2016, Russia boasts the sixth-biggest economy in the world, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Now, it’s true to say nominal dollar GDP has taken a big hit since the 2014 currency crisis, but Moscow isn’t paying out on wages, pensions and most general budget expenditure in greenbacks, it’s doing so in\\xa0rubles.\\xa0It’s also worth comparing the Russian economy ($3.7 trillion) to other UN Security Council permanent members such as France ($2.7 trillion) and Britain ($2.8 trillion).\\xa0 Let’s not forget the “isolation” argument either. A cursory glance at Putin’s website shows\\xa0how in the past eight days he has had private and personal meetings with the following: South Africa’s Jacob Zuma, China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Brazil’s Michel Temer, Armenia’s Serzh Sargsyan, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. He’s also conducted phone calls with Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Francois Hollande and the new United Nations’ Secretary General Antonio Guterres. This is not the diary of the leader of an “isolated” country, is it? So, Obama has changed tack. And that’s fair enough. Russia is now “large and important,” albeit “aggressive.” Naturally, the US itself is never threatening or combative and its bombs are made of candy.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Putin: White House uses Russia scaremongering to manipulate Americans Let’s be clear, Obama’s overall interaction with Russia has been disastrous. He never understood the country, nor apparently wanted to get a proper grasp on it. To compound matters, the US president also chose badly when it came to advisors on the subject. Hiring the likes of Michael McFaul – whose brief tenure as ambassador to Moscow was catastrophic, hanging out with fringe opposition activists upon arrival being about the silliest move possible – and allowing Victoria (“F**k the EU”) Nuland to be retained as the State Department’s point person in Russia’s neighborhood.\\xa0 In 2012, Obama was unwittingly recorded telling former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that\\xa0he would be more “flexible” on Russia upon his re-election for a second term. As Obama’s presidency enters its lame duck last months, there’s still a brief window to salvage something from Washington-Moscow relations.\\xa0 If Obama fails to grasp this chance, he'll leave his successor civil wars in Ukraine and Syria to manage and a dysfunctional rapport with the Kremlin to transform.

First there was denial: surely Angela Merkel couldn’t be so stupid as to sink the European ship? Next came anger as news of the\\xa0organized attacks by so-called asylum-seekers on European white women seeped through the checkpoints\\xa0embedded in the mainstream media machine. Then came the stage known as bargaining as people thought they would settle for some\\xa0restrictions on numbers so long as the tidal wave was stopped. And now we are at enforced acceptance: the tidal wave will not stop – so get used to it – with Jeremy Corbyn, for example,\\xa0calling for the UK to take similar numbers as Germany. If you feel like you didn’t vote for any of this, that’s because you didn’t. Your opinion isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. It’s people like\\xa0George Soros who are making these decisions. Your job is to shut up, pay taxes, and learn to\\xa0get on board with this new round of social engineering and ethnic cleansing. But now that it is obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that – hand-wringing apart – the fix is in, it is interesting to observe how career politicians are talking now that the dust is settling on the new reality. Because talk is all that they will do. We are at the tipping point. And once we get over that, the ship is going down, make no mistake. The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, for example, has managed – albeit belatedly – to get an intellectual handle on what’s going on: the refugee crisis is\\xa0destabilizing Europe. Now, he does not mean what you and I mean by Europe: our countries, nations, languages and histories. He’s a\\xa0Bilderberger so he has at least a mid-level understanding of the actual plan and doesn’t care about any of the things the people who vote for him care about. He means the Union of European Soviet Socialist Republics; the Brussels oligarchy in other words. The Guardian writes: ‘He said a message to refugees that said “Come, you will be welcome” provoked major shifts in population.’ His grasp of the obvious now it is too late to do anything about it is impressive. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Europe was close to breaking point: “We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks.” But, he went on: “No one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive.” Geert Wilders is described by the liberal press as a\\xa0‘far-right’ Dutch politician. This means he has stayed roughly where our grandparents were while everyone else was processed by Cultural Marxism. Wilders has called for the invading, marauding males to be locked up in asylum centers and for the safety of Dutch women and girls to be put first. What a novel idea. This isn’t ‘far-right’. It is just right. But, we already know, it will never happen. RT\\xa0interviewed Hansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party. Mueller said: ‘Germany now is somewhere at the edge of anarchy and sliding towards civil war, or to become a \"banana republic without any government.\" He went on: ‘Bavaria is the first region because we are affected the most – we are living on the border to Austria where the influx of refugees stems from. But the second regions of Germany where this happens are Saxony and Thuringia. First of all, they have also borders to the Czech Republic, that’s the first reason. And the second reason is that in former Eastern Germany people are still aware of what it is living in a dictatorship. They are feeling quite well that our so-called democracy is sliding more and more towards a totalitarian state.’’ Interesting and objectively correct words. But then Mueller does not hold any real power. Donald Tusk, on the other hand – as chief apparatchik in the European Soviet machine – does have power. He now\\xa0warns that we have only two months to get things under control. This means, of course, when after two months the invasion is only worse, we will be expected to accept the situation as fait accompli. Tusk also has a holy reverence for the nonsense known as the Schengen Agreement and warned that if Europe fails to make the strategy work “we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen,” the 26-nation passport-free travel zone. How complicated is it? There is nothing holy about the Schengen Agreement – the UK is not party to it, for example. But European leaders talk about it as though it were\\xa0somehow problematic to revoke it. It’s not. The Schengen is an idea. The invasion of Europe and the destruction of the ancient cultures within it, however, is very real. If these were not ‘refugees’ but infantrymen (even ones without guns) arriving from – let’s say – North Korea, this problem would not have got to first base. This is an invasion. But because it is dressed up in the garb Europeans fall for every time – the language of compassion – we are now in a state where European women\\xa0cannot walk unmolested in their own streets or\\xa0use public pools without being subjected to degradation. Given the political will, this problem can be fixed in a five-minute conversation. It’s a group Skype call at best. The fact that this doesn’t happen belies the reality: the fix is in, and politicians like Valls and apparatchiks like Tusk are trying to distance themselves from the inevitable fallout. This is why they are saying things they think people will want to hear: not because they are going to step up and do what is necessary, but because they don’t want the coming chaos attached to their names. The solution is obvious: stop ‘saving’ all the ships arriving in Europe; put officers with real powers on borders, and have anyone without a passport or other valid ID immediately ejected from the EU space. And border guards both at the peripheries of individual countries and the EU itself should be told in clear and uncertain terms what their job is: to protect what’s behind them from what’s in front of them. If EU border guards’ pay was inversely indexed to the number of persons shown to have entered the EU illegally – and if internal police had equivalent motivations – this problem would be solved in a month. If there is a genuine case for asylum – based on the existing legal framework – the place for that discussion is on the border of the EU, not within it. Germany has followed Switzerland in\\xa0confiscating the assets of ‘refugees’ over a certain value – shown to be\\xa0four-figure sums on average. This will do nothing other than ensure that the next wave comes with nothing, or has it sent over in parcels later. The real causes for invasion lie with neo-colonialism and the banking cartel which drives it – ‘philanthropists’ such as Soros – and NATO’s genocide against Libya and the murder of Gaddafi – who was holding back the population floodgates for us. NATO has no compunction about killing people in very large numbers when it suits the bankers’ agenda. The fact that Europe’s military is pussy-footing around now that we actually need soldiers to do their only legitimate job – defend our borders – suddenly everyone is Albert Schweitzer. The case is so plain, even 16 year-old German girls with no previous interest in ‘politics’ are getting it. Anyone who suggests taking effective action is labelled ‘far-right’ by the liberal media which panders to those whose intellects are bypassed by means of emotional trigger-words such as ‘compassion’. But the motif of the ship is a fair one. When a ship goes down there are never enough lifeboats. Sailors are trained to beat off with violence those still in the sea once the lifeboat is full. If they do not – everyone dies. This is real compassion. If there is a silver lining in this tale of corruption and perfidy it is this: the liberal’s catch-all justification for his crimes against his own people – that of pleading ‘compassion’ – is no longer beyond criticism. People have had enough. Wanting your family and your culture to survive does not make you evil. This is not a game; it is deadly serious. And if the helm cannot be wrest from those bent on taking the ship down, it’s time for those with the wit and the means to make a quiet move for the exits. @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

In March, the Russian President said that starting from the second half of 2016; all state-backed companies should switch to Russian software. If public authorities want to buy foreign software, they must first consult with a special registry and make sure that there are no similar Russian products. If there are Russian alternatives, authorities will have to explain why Russian software doesn’t suit their needs. Next year, Moscow wants to expand the software substitution developed by Russian company New Cloud Technologies to as many as 600,000 machines, said Artem Yermolaev, head of information technology at the Russian telecoms operator\\xa0Rostelecom. Microsoft Windows and Office may be abolished later on, Yermolaev added. According to the Minister of Communications and Mass Media Nikolay Nikiforov, Russia spends about 20 billion rubles (over $300 million) every year on foreign software, while local companies are ready to provide the government with similar IT solutions.

            "['19 Feb, 2016 17:17 ', 'No strategic divide between US & Turkey – only a division of labor', 'op-edge', \"One week ago, on February 10, units from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance captured Menagh airbase and several surrounding villages in northwest Syria from Al-Qaeda franchise Jabhat Al-Nusra and their allies Ahrar Al Sham, who had held it since August 2013. One might think the liberation of such a significant asset would be a cause for celebration amongst the NATO powers who are, after all, supposedly facing an existential threat from Al-Qaeda and its various offshoots. But apparently not. By the weekend, NATO member Turkey was shelling the base and its surrounding regions, with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu vowing to render it “unusable” unless the SDF withdraw – that is to say, hand it back to Al-Qaeda. Their bombardment has continued ever since, hitting Syrian government forces in the town of Deir Jamal, as well as the SDF. Davutoglu promised “the harshest reaction” if the SDF were to take the town of Azaz – currently controlled by, you guessed it,\\xa0Ahrar al Sham and Al-Qaeda – towards which they were rapidly advancing. “We will not allow Azaz to fall,” he said, ‘fall’ here being a euphemism for liberation from the Wahhabi death squads. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have been regularly briefing the media about their desire to send their armies into Syria, to establish a ‘safe zone’ on the Turkish-Syrian border aimed at keeping open the supply lines to rebel-controlled territories such as Aleppo (dominated, according to the Institute for the Study of War, by Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Ahrar Al Sham). Turkish military sources have subsequently announced that Saudi jets are to be deployed at the Incirlik airbase in Turkey within the coming weeks. For some commentators, all of this demonstrates that Turkey has somehow gone ‘rogue’, putting it at odds with the US and straining the sinews of its alliance. Turkey is facilitating militant jihadis, it is argued, whilst the US is trying to fight them; and it is attacking the SDF, who the US is supporting. The SDF is, after all, an official ally of the US, who has been advancing thanks in part to US air support – yet is viewed by Turkey as a terrorist group due to the presence in their ranks of the Kurdish YPG, who have fraternal relations with the PKK, with whom the Turkish state has been at war for decades. For the Guardian, “the Turkish strikes…triggered alarm in Washington”, whilst a Reuters headline\\xa0suggested that the “Kurdish advance in Syria divides US and Turkey”. “Following Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's remarks calling on the US to choose between its ally Turkey and “the terrorists in Kobani,”\\xa0wrote the Turkish newspaper Sunday’s Zaman “Ankara is now not on good terms with the US”. The reality, however, is that Turkey appears to have had US approval every step of the way. Take, for example, the official US reaction to the Turkish shelling. Statements by State Department spokesman John Kirby have generally been depicted as ‘admonishing’ Turkey for its actions. In fact, he called for “de-escalating tensions on all sides,” adding that “we have urged Syrian Kurdish and other forces affiliated with the YPG not to take advantage of a confused situation by seizing new territory.” In other words, he has repeated Turkey’s demands that northwest Syria be left under Al-Qaeda control. This hardly qualifies as a major dressing down. Also hugely important to note is that right between the seizure of Menagh on Wednesday and the beginning of Turkish shelling on Saturday, NATO had 2 important meetings: one formal, one informal. On Thursday, buried deep in an announcement about NATO operations in the Aegean Sea, Secretary\\xa0General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned that NATO had also agreed “to intensify intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance at the Turkish-Syrian border.” That was the formal meeting. Later that day – that is just one day before the International Syria Support Group announced plans for a “cessation of hostilities” - the defense secretaries of the US, the UK, Turkey and the Gulf states met at NATO HQ to discuss the possibility of inserting ground troops into Syria and establishing a “no-fly zone” on the Syrian-Turkish border. Talking in advance of this meeting, US Defense Secretary\\xa0Ash Carter appeared to relish such action, welcoming the prospect of “strong contributions” from the Gulf States, which he said would be a “good thing”. “There are lots of different ways that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain can contribute,” he noted, “one of them is on the ground – and we’ll definitely be discussing that – but there are lots of other ways as well.” Two days later, Turkey began shelling Syria. Ostensibly, these were meetings of the ‘anti-ISIS’ coalition. But, as the Guardian innocently noted, “Given that the US and its allies have been in action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since September 2014, it is remarkable that the meeting on Thursday afternoon is the first to be held by the defense ministers from the anti-ISIS coalition.” What has really prompted their sense of urgency has nothing to do with the ‘phony‘ war against ISIS, and everything to do with the growing military success of the Syrian government. Rhetorical nonsense about the need to ‘combat ISIS’ notwithstanding, it is clear that Turkey and the West remain very much on the same page over Syria. There is indeed a red line for both, and that red line is the prospect of a Syrian government victory – which, following Russia’s decisive intervention now seems like a very real possibility. The major rebel supply line to Aleppo was cut off on February 3, meaning that both the recapture of Aleppo and the sealing of the Turkish-Syrian border now lie visibly within the government’s grasp. As Reuters has correctly noted, “That would amount to its most decisive victory of the war so far, and probably put an end to rebel hopes of removing Assad by force, their goal throughout years of fighting that has driven 11 million people from their homes.” Such an outcome would have monumental consequences for the entire globe. It would mark the first decisive defeat for a Western-sponsored regime change operation since the end of the Cold War, perhaps since Vietnam. It would demonstrate that the new ‘4+1’ alliance (of Iran, Iraq, Russia, Syria and Hezbollah) are able to inflict defeat on Western-backed forces, rendering US sponsorship and protection all but worthless. It would provide states over the world with the military rationale (the economic rationale is already obvious) for aligning themselves with the BRICS rather than the US. And it would make sectarian death squads throughout the region, for long the ‘cheap power’ arm of US and British foreign policy, wary of ever again relying on Western backing. In short, it would mark an unprecedented and irreversible shift in power from West to East. There is no way that the Western powers are going to allow this to happen lying down. And plans are rapidly being drawn up to avoid this. The aim is to ensure the Syrian-Turkish border stays open, to guarantee that the rebels supply lines are not jeopardized; this is the only way to avoid defeat in, not only, Aleppo, but in Syria as a whole. How to do this? First, Turkey is filling the Syrian side of its border crossing with refugees to act as human shields. Last week, for the first time, President Erdogan closed the border to fleeing refugees, instead setting up camps inside Syria. These will provide the ‘collateral damage’ necessary to paint any Syrian government-Kurdish – Russian moves to take the territory and seal the border as a massacre and humanitarian emergency. Erdogan’s comments last week that the United Nations needed to step in to prevent “ethnic cleansing” are clearly part of the ideological groundwork to prepare for a ‘humanitarian intervention’ which, in reality, will serve to create a NATO-backed, Turkish and Saudi-enforced, occupation zone in northwest Syria designed to keep the border open, keep the death squads supplied with weapons and fighters, and, in short, keep the war going. Far from angering Washington, Turkey’s actions put it right at the vanguard of US strategic designs. Make no mistake; the US is preparing to fight Russia – right down to the last Turk.

It was not immediately clear whether the notice published in the French Official Journal was mandatory or advisory. The French guidelines state that in accordance with Commission rules adopted in November 2015, importers must mark the precise place from which the goods originate and not mark them as products of Israel. Regulations apply to products that originate in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which are considered occupied territories under international law. French authorities said that clearly marking the packaging is necessary to not mislead consumers. Goods originating from Palestinian territories must be marked for instance as originating from “the West Bank”, and then, in parenthesis, the package must also be labeled that it comes from “an Israeli settlement.” When in November 2015 European Commission guidelines were adopted, Brussels stated that enforcing the regulations is the responsibility of the authorities within each of the 28 EU countries. A year later France decided to implement the new rules, unleashing condemnation from Israel, which considers the move a “boycott” of Israeli products. It calls the new regulations as embodying “double standards.” “It is a puzzling and disturbing fact that France chooses to implement a double standard when it comes to Israel while ignoring the 200 territorial conflicts which are taking place today across the world, including those taking place right on their doorstep,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We regret that France, of all countries, in which a law exists against boycotts, is taking steps which can be interpreted as a nod of support to radical elements and the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] BDS movement against Israel,” the statement added.

This is despite the fact that in 2014 Syria carried out a presidential election, Syrians all over the world voted in it and we saw people abroad in places like Lebanon, Jordan actively and enthusiastically participating in these elections.

Neil Stansfield, from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is responsible for the research, told the Telegraph on Wednesday that the scanner freezes atoms with lasers and then gauges how they are affected by the gravitational pull of objects close to them. This can apparently help create a 3D map of an area. Stansfield told the newspaper the scanners could have a number of advantages. “Seeing underground is an obvious one. From a national security perspective, the potential is obvious if you can see caves and tunnels,” he said. It’s also claimed that the device is impossible to jam or confuse because it does not “send out waves” of any kind. “We are detecting the gravitational influence on an object. There’s nothing that we are sending out that can be interfered with,” Stansfield said. Non-military uses could include helping road workers find buried pipes. Stansfield told the Telegraph that the technology, while not ready for use currently, would be fully functional sooner than people think.\\xa0 “I think until about five years ago, this was seen as laboratory stuff and it will be 20 or 30 years before we can harness this,” he said. It has also been argued that gravity technology could come to replace global positioning systems (GPS), which are vulnerable to electronic attacks like jamming. Gravity navigation, known as quantum sensing, remains an experimental field, according to experts. However, a recent DSTL paper\\xa0says that the technology has “the potential to enhance existing, or enable new defense capabilities including positioning, navigation, communications, control and sensing.” The claim that gravity scanners are immune to jamming comes at a time when a covert technology debate is underway. As recently as Tuesday it was reported that UK infantry soldiers had field-tested a new stealth material at Fort Benning, Georgia, home of the US military’s experimental warfare facility. The material, called Vatec, would be used in camouflage clothing and to help build hides for teams of snipers. However, William Boothby, a former air force officer and lawyer, argued in a study published in the journal Weapons and the Law of Armed Conflict in March that the new systems may breach the laws of war. “A combatant whose weapon is rendered invisible by its coating is arguably not complying with the minimal requirements [of carrying a weapon openly],” Boothby claims.

RT:\\xa0The Boycott, Divestment and Sanction Movement was established in 2005. Perhaps, it has potential to be the most effective movement. Could you explain what it is, how it started and its spread, especially now, in Europe and in the United States? Miko Peled: We need to start with the premise that not everybody accepts, which is that the Palestinians have a right to resist. The issue of resistance is somehow always left out of the conversation. Under international law they do have a right. But somehow when we talk about Palestinians, I think the word resistance gives some kind of legitimacy to their struggle. And therefore it is never part of the conversation: they can be victims, they can be terrorists. But that’s kind of it. I think what BDS has done among many things - is to have brought the issue of resistance to the forefront because it is very legitimate, it reminds us of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Could you layout what does Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions mean? MP: The call Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, to begin with, came out, which I think is an important point, from Palestinian civil society. Perhaps, the largest coalition of individuals and organizations from within Palestine came out with a call…for the world to support Palestine through imposing boycotts, divesting from and imposing sanctions on the State of Israel, against using the South African model. I think it captured people's imagination; it reminded people of this struggle against apartheid in South Africa. It is very dedicated and it's kind of the latest attempt of the Palestinian resistance. But it has a legitimacy that I think previous examples of the resistance didn't have. And I think, which is why it's being so successful and why it's being able to maintain itself. RT:\\xa0It has been quite successful in institutions such as the Presbyterian Church that I come out of, that supported it, very effective in Europe. Talk a little bit about what it has achieved.

[East Jerusalem is the Palestinian section of Jerusalem, which is being rapidly rebuilt. –Chris Hedges] The attempt has been right away as soon as East Jerusalem was taken in 1967, to expand Jewish West Jerusalem into it and eliminate any kind of Palestinian existence within it. And they’ve been very successful. This Light Rail was one of those examples. It was a very successful campaign\\xa0in working with Veolia and pressuring them to stop working with Israel. They work with other companies, there's the examples of Caterpillar and another work, there's a campaign on HP…and the idea is that companies that either work directly with Israel or have some more profit from the occupation or support the military occupation of Palestine need to be influenced in order just to stop working with Israel... I think it's important to also make a point that if we take a look at the United Nations definition of genocide and if we take a look at Israeli policies over the last 70 years in Palestine, the similarities are striking. It is almost point for point. We're talking about how and why this is happening, why there is a call to boycott Israel and why the BDS movement is making so much sense because something has to be done on a worldwide scale. It is not something that you can put a little bomb here or there. It is not that kind of thing.

Now migrants coming to Austria to travel through Germany and beyond will be denied access and sent back home, Austrian authorities said on Friday. Slovenia is expected to resort to similar measures in order to avoid becoming a refugee bottleneck. “What is the situation currently on the German-Austrian border? That only those who want asylum in Germany are being let through, and those who want to travel onward are sent back,” Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told state broadcaster ORF, as quoted by Reuters. “We will stop them directly on our southern border [with Slovenia] as of the end of next week,” Mikl-Leitner added. The soldiers’ presence will be made “clearly visible” to deter migrants trying to find illegal ways into Austria. Over 3,000 migrants who arrived under false identities have been sent back, border officials reported. Slovenia will also have to take a similar decision or cope with the rejected migrants, a Slovenian Interior Ministry official said. Austria has been engaged in trilateral talks with Germany and Slovenia aimed at finding new ways to manage the refugee and migrant influx. The negotiations went well and have so far resulted in tightened border control checks to stop illegal immigration, according to Mikl-Leitner. “The states have agreed that a joint solution has to be reached,” Slovenian State Secretary Bostjan Sefic said, adding that Slovenia will deal with the problem on its own if the countries fail to come up with a coordinated response. The whole process was started by Germany, which since the beginning of January has been turning away hundreds of migrants with fake IDs heading to Sweden or Denmark. Those people then turned up in neighboring Austria and Slovenia. Austria and Slovenia have been a way station for hundreds of thousands migrants heading to Germany since September. Only 90,000 migrants have applied for asylum in Austria compared to 1.1 million taken in by Germany.

Proteins perform most cellular functions and are the reason we are all alive. “Translation is the fundamental biological process for converting mRNA’s information into proteins,”\\xa0said the paper’s co-author, Dr. Robert Singer, who is co-chair of anatomy and structural biology and co-director of the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center at Einstein. In scientific first, researchers visualize proteins being born https://t.co/j56B3lMkIH@EinsteinMed For the first challenge, Dr. Bin Wu, the lead author of the study, adapted a technique from an earlier paper published in 1998 that visualized single molecules of mRNA in living cells. By adding “mRNA that codes for red fluorescent protein” to a retrovirus and inserting it into cells, the translation could be seen. For the second challenge, Dr. Wu used a recently published technique to encode single-chain antibodies fused to green fluorescent protein to bind to a newly formed protein, “making the protein visible.” Visualizing the birth of proteins 🔬 https://t.co/WsXx5zKTlf Dr. Singer explained, “We know from genome-wide studies that translation controls protein abundance in cells – crucially important to every single function that cells carry out.

Then they made a surprising discovery. When they looked at the translation in mouse neurons, they noticed “mRNA translation into protein was found to occur in ‘bursts’ – a phenomenon never before possible to observe,” according to the Einstein statement. “Bursts of translation activity may be the best way for neurons to control the amount and location of protein production – and neurological disease may result from neurons’ inability to control that bursting,”\\xa0said Dr. Singer. “So our findings may have implications for intellectual disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome, which seem to involve too much protein production, and possibly for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s in which clumps of beta-amyloid protein may block neuron-to-neuron signaling at synapses.” 1000+ yr shelf life: Microsoft buys into synthetic DNA for data storagehttps://t.co/xFzWUzSRWkpic.twitter.com/TM1QDB2E7d When researchers looked at mRNA translation in cancer cells, they noticed that they “displayed a striking inability to regulate the translation of mRNA… instead it was [a] continuous process in these cells.” “Since proteins play crucial roles in controlling division, the uncontrolled translation of certain proteins may lead to certain types of cancer,” stated Einstein College. “With our technology, researchers can now study disease-causing protein aberrations at a very basic level that was never possible before,” said Dr. Singer.

Its buildings include the domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower, the Opera del Duomo Museum, and the St. John Baptistery. Florence\\'s mayor, Dario Nardella, rejected McDonald\\'s application in June, saying \"McDonald\\'s has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.\" \"We don\\'t have any prejudice [against McDonald\\'s],\" Nardella said, noting that the company had opened restaurants \"in other parts of town.\" A Facebook campaign launched to oppose the opening of a McDonald’s restaurant on the historic plaza received more than 17,000 likes. “There is no need for a McDonald’s in such a beautiful place.

The 558,000 b/d figure was voiced by Qatar\\'s energy minister\\xa0at a press conference following the six hour long talks. OPEC members also confirmed their commitment to the plan to reduce the oil supply by 1.2 million b/d. This, together with the commitments made by non-OPEC states, would lead to the total reduction of oil production by about 1.7-1.8 million b/d, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at the press conference. Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Falih told the press conference that 2017 would be a “good year” for the global oil market. The parties to the negotiations also agreed to form a special group to monitor the observance of the agreement both by the OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The group would consist of three OPEC members and two non-OPEC countries, Novak said. \"This agreement cements and prepares us for long-term cooperation,\" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters after the meeting, calling the deal \"historic\". \"Today\\'s deal will speed up the oil market stabilisation, reduce volatility, attract new investments,\" Novak said. The deal became the first such agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries since 2001. In April, OPEC and Russia tried to reach a deal on oil production which was cut during negotiations in Doha, but failed to come to an agreement, as Saudi Arabia sunk the deal at the last moment. OPEC made a decision to cut its own output on November 30. Following the decision, Saudi Arabia informed its customers in Europe and North America that it would cut its oil supply in January. According to PIRA Energy Group chairman Gary Ross, buyers of Saudi oil were informed that Riyadh wants to cut its production by 486,000 b/d to just over 10 million. UAE then followed suit and also announced that it would take similar action. While some non-OPEC countries are also expected to cut their oil production in January, others have said they might wait until October. OPEC’s November decision put an end to the ’pump-at-will’ policy the group has conducted since 2014, which sent oil prices down from $100 a barrel to less than $50 a barrel. Now, both OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters are trying to push prices up. The market reacted to the November move with rising oil prices, which went up by 17 percent after the group announced its decision. The prices continued to go up on Friday amid speculation that non-OPEC countries would agree to cuts. The projected reduction in oil production amounting to up to 1.8 billion b/d, that is set to follow the Saturday agreement and OPEC\\'s November decision, would account for about two percent of the current global oil supply.

Bangladesh and its Western partners are concerned about a surge in terrorism in the country and have boosted measures to fight it. Last month, the US and Bangladesh signed a counter-terrorism agreement. RT: Are we seeing a surge in terrorism in Bangladesh now? Why do you think that is? Ahmed Quraishi: There is little question that ever since prime-minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed came to power in 2009, we are seeing here in this region a dramatic rise in extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh. This is very clear. And the most interesting part of this phenomenon is the reaction of the government itself, how effective the reaction of the PM Hasina Wazed government has been to these rising extremism. And I think this scorecard is really not very encouraging. We’ve seen the government, on the one hand, being very decisive against these groups in terms of the statements coming from government ministers and the actions on the ground. But at the same time, we have not seen those actions really translate into a reduction in these attacks. On the contrary, we are seeing a rise. So, there is a question that a lot of people are asking right now, and that is whether some of the actions, some of the high-handedness by the government of PM Hasina Wazed is actually contributing to the rise of extremism. And I am specifically\\xa0referring to the executions of some of the political opponents of the PM. Those trials were about the cases dated back to 1971, the independence of Bangladesh. But the very fact that those trials were conducted now, and the manner in which they were conducted, and the fact that most of the people who were executed belong to the religious groups – I think this is one key factor in this rising trend of extremism in Bangladesh under the reign of PM Hasina Wazed since 2009.\\xa0\\xa0 RT: The US is concerned about the situation in Bangladesh.

Ever since the military operation on the Kurdish population in the Cizre region began, members of the European Parliament have been addressing Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in open letters and public speeches, calling on him to put an end to the violence in Turkish regions inhabited by Kurds. “The objective of the Erdogan government is to completely have a genocidal campaign against the Kurds, because that’s what’s now occurring,” said Gregory Copley, editor of the journal Defense and Foreign Affairs. “This is now genocide, because the Turkish government has denied that there is any major military operation underway there.” The Turkish military has clearly been using “heavy ground weapons” in Cizre and “possibly even air weapons,” he added.  Commenting on the violence in Cizre, Kani Xulam, director of the American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN), accused Erdogan’s government of war crimes. “What the government of Turkey has done in Cizre is a war crime. They have attacked civilians who have not taken part in the fighting,” Xulam told RT, stressing that the Turkish military attacked Kurdish civilians that were not taking part in the fighting. “In a country that is aspiring to join the European Union and calls itself a member of NATO, you don’t target a whole town,” the expert said, adding that the “laws of war” imply making a distinction between civilians and belligerents. Tough Turkey: ‘Kurds fighting for their rights labeled as terrorists’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/pa8U1zdZ8opic.twitter.com/IzahzHMXcK According to data provided by the Turkish Human Rights Foundation, “178 civilians were deliberately targeted in three different basements and among some of the dead were children as young as nine to 10 years old…The government not only deliberately targeted and killed them, but also burned them. Some relatives were given piles of bones of their loved ones,” Xulam said. Xulam believes that Ankara’s offensive against the Kurds stems from the fact that Erdogan wants to be an uncontested “supreme leader” or “sultan” of Turkey, which the Kurdish population and its MPs strongly oppose. According to Xulam, Erdogan’s goal is to make the significant Kurdish ethnic minority (15 to 30 percent of Turkey’s population by various estimates) accept “inferior” status as “subjects,” and stop demanding language and cultural rights, as well as autonomy. 'Burned alive':Shocking scenes from Cizre where 150 people allegedly torched to death https://t.co/zbYaZYPi9lpic.twitter.com/ziHD3LaREv The Turkish military operation against PKK militants in the southeastern part of the country was launched in July 2015, breaking a ceasefire agreement that had held for two years. At the time of the alleged mass murder in Cizre, Turkish state television announced that 60 “terrorists” were killed in a building basement. The operation in Cizre, which, according to Turkish Interior Minister Efkan Ala, was completed “in a very successful fashion,” officially ended early February. The alleged atrocities have brought little reaction from Western governments, as Turkey is a NATO member state and crucial to stemming the refugee and migrant crisis gripping Europe.\\xa0 Most criticism has come from international human rights groups. Amnesty International reported in January that at least 150 civilians, women and children among them, had been killed in the Turkish military operation, saying that some 200,000 people had been put at risk and were being denied access to services due to strict curfews. “Cuts to water and electricity supplies combined with the dangers of accessing food and medical care while under fire are having a devastating effect on residents, and the situation is likely to get worse, fast, if this isn’t addressed,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia, as cited in the report. Pointing out the lax reaction to the human rights violations committed en mass by Turkish authorities against the Kurdish population, he urged the international community not to turn a blind on the conflict. “While the Turkish authorities appear determined to silence internal criticism, they have faced very little from the international community. Strategic considerations relating to the conflict in Syria and determined efforts to enlist Turkey’s help in stemming the flow of refugees to Europe must not overshadow allegations of gross human rights violations,” he added. \"]\n",

In early March 2014, soon after the international sanctions against Russia were introduced for the first time, this share was significantly larger at 56 percent. However, the decrease of concerned Russians could be explained by the fact that currently 43 percent of respondents think that sanctions have only had an insignificant negative effect on the Russian economy, while another 20 percent said there was no negative effect at all. Only 29 percent of those polled believe that Western sanctions had caused a significant problem for Russia’s economy.

Only 21 percent said that they supported negotiations with the West and a search for a mutually-acceptable solution that would allow the sanctions against Russia to be lifted. In the same poll, 58 percent of respondents said that they thought that reciprocal sanctions introduced by Russia were very effective because they afforded it more respect from foreign nations. Twenty-three percent said these restrictions were “senseless and absurd” and that they primarily hurt Russia’s own population. Levada head Lev Gudkov told Kommersant daily that the current outline in public opinion could be explained as the average citizen feeling that Russia is regaining its status as a great world power, and believing that international prestige is more important than the current economic situation. READ MORE: Russians list US, Ukraine & Turkey as country’s main enemies in latest poll The sanctions exchange started in mid-2014 as the US, EU and a number of their allies introduced sanctions against Russian companies and politicians over Russia’s alleged role in the Ukrainian political crisis and the accession of the Crimean Republic into the Russian Federation. In August 2014, the Russian government reciprocated with a ban on the import on meat, poultry, fish, cheese, milk, fruit and vegetables from the US, EU, Australia, Canada, Norway and other countries that had joined the initial Western sanctions. The ban was initially to last for a year, but was later prolonged until August 2016, and more recently until December 31, 2017, due to the unwillingness of the West to lift restrictions on Russia.

Twenty thousand are just people who have some very particular wishes. For example, they want to take into their family a blue-eyed fair-haired girl under the age of three. But there are very few such children, the majority of kids in the existing ‘bank’ have various problems – they can be disabled, have brothers and sisters whom they don’t want to be separated from, or simply are older,” Zimova said. The possible solution to this problem is to create a state-run nationwide database of prospective parents. It would include anyone who approaches orphanages with a request to adopt, she said. Institutions all over Russia would then be able to offer the children in their care. This is currently very difficult. “The existing database is not perfect; there is no search system in it. It only has descriptions of prospective parents – to find candidates with particular features specialists have to personally read every file,” Zimova told Izvestia. READ MORE: Russian government drafts fresh bill facilitating domestic adoptions She noted that once the unified database is complete, it could make realistic proposals to would-be adopters.Zimova promised to put her proposals in a letter and send it to the Education and Science Ministry soon. Russian officials and activists started a campaign to boost domestic adoptions after a series of restrictions on international adoptions came into force over recent years. It started with the Dima Yakovlev Law that appeared on the statute books at the beginning of 2013. The law banned any adoption of Russian kids by US citizens or by proxy of US organizations. It was prompted by repeated US refusals to allow Russian diplomats and law enforcers to participate in the investigation of numerous cases of maltreatment, sexual exploitation and even killings of Russian children by US adoptive parents. In February 2014, the rules were tightened again when Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree banning the adoption of Russian children by foreign same-sex couples, as well as by unmarried citizens of countries where same-sex marriage is legal. In 2015, the Russian government introduced a series of tax benefits for citizens who adopted orphans and also streamlined some requirements for would-be adopters, making the procedure easier.

The records dump took place on Thursday – New Year’s Eve – the start of a long holiday weekend when most people are more focused on celebrating. On October 20, 2014, 17-year-old McDonald was walking away from police while carrying a small knife when he was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke, who this week pled not guilty to murder charges following the release of a dashcam video last month. The IPRA is billed as a civilian agency within the city government. It is responsible for assessing police shootings, but many emails reveal that the agency coordinated its handling of the case with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s staff. Anti-violence protesters march through streets of Chicago on New Year Evehttps://t.co/EonYZ4cba4pic.twitter.com/xZ0wJGORnH On December 5, 2014, former IPRA chief Scott Ando emailed Janey Rountree, Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Safety, to provide a “list of cases pending review by either the [State Attorney’s Office] or the [US Attorney’s Office]” involving Chicago police misconduct. Ando also indicated which officers were being charged at the time. “In this case it was a status update on cases that were being reviewed by prosecutors for possible criminal investigation. The mayor’s office obviously does not direct investigations, nor are any employees involved in those investigations,” Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, told the Chicago Sun-Times. In another email to Rountree, Collins expressed frustration with the IPRA for not taking his advice when responding to a question from the media regarding McDonald. That May 26 email reads in part, “Against my recommendation, IPRA has already provided this response that was a little antagonistic. I’ve asked that they follow up with this as well to soften and reinforce their message,” while going on to provide a paragraph that played up IPRA’s investigatory powers and its independence. In an earlier email dated April 10 to Stephen Patton Collins, a top legal adviser to Mayor Emanuel, Collins had expressed more satisfaction with the IPRA. In that one he reported that Jeremy Gorner of the Chicago Tribune had “just asked IPRA about the McDonald settlement,” alluding to the $5 million civil payout to the McDonald family. “IPRA is giving him the statement we approved,” Collins wrote, going on to paste the two sentence statement. #Chicago announces 'fundamental' changes to police practices https://t.co/1LPTO4xErYpic.twitter.com/x8x5aoiebR On November 18, a week before the release of the dashcam footage showing McDonald’s killing, Collins emailed several representatives of police and law departments telling them, “we need one voice on this topic,” and then provided a “city statement” to provide talking points. “Here’s a first crack. I don’t think we should stray far from where we have been all along on this,” the email reads, before providing a draft of an official explanation as to why the video has yet to be released. The dump of internal emails has only fueled more criticism of Chicago’s government on social media and in the streets of Chicago, where protests calling for Emanuel’s resignation have not let up. Dozens of protesters gathered at Emanuel’s home for the third evening in a row on Thursday, promising to show up for at least another 13 days to symbolize the 16 gunshots McDonald took from police.

Konashenkov criticized Washington once more for its unwillingness to force Syrian opposition groups that it has influence over to adhere to the terms of the ceasefire. “All our requests to the US side to provide contacts of \\'moderate oppositionists\\' or to influence them have been to no avail. On the contrary, the ... shelling of the Syrian government troops\\' positions ... is only growing, he said. The Americans have also failed to separate the ‘moderate’ opposition from terrorists as was agreed under the terms of the Syrian ceasefire, brokered by Moscow and Washington on September 9, the spokesman said. “After a week of ceasefire, it has become clear that the US side has neither influence nor even contacts with \\'moderate oppositionists\\' acting on the ground in Syria rather than in western capitals,” he added. According to Konashenkov, the most difficult situation is currently in Aleppo. \"Militants are using the ceasefire to lick wounds, recuperate and prepare for resumption of combat operations,\" he said. The jihadists are “pulling manpower and weapons in the areas they control, both during the day and at night,” capitalizing on the fact “that the government troops aren’t opening retaliatory fire,” he said. Objective control tools, other reconnaissance channels and accounts from civilians indicated the movement of fighters and a concentration of armored vehicles and cars in the eastern part of Aleppo and in the city’s suburbs. \"Such facts only prove our apprehension of regrouping of terrorist groups and their preparing large-scale combat operations,\" Konashenkov said.

Syrian president, Bashar Assad’s political and media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban, confirmed to RT that militants are taking advantage of the ceasefire. “Unfortunately, the terrorists regroup and rearm with every truce and with every cancellation of hostilities. And that’s because the US is hesitant to strike at the terrorists in Syria,” she told RT. The ceasefire in Syria was agreed during talks on September 9 as the sides agreed to influence the Syrian government and the so-called moderate rebel forces respectively in order to end hostilities. Since then, Moscow has repeatedly complained that Washington is failing to keep its part of the bargain. The US, on its part, has blamed Russia for not pressuring Damascus enough to facilitate humanitarian access to Syria. But the ceasefire was put at risk by the bombing of Syrian government forces by US-led coalition warplanes on Saturday. Some 62 soldiers were killed and 100 more wounded. Shaaban said it’s difficult to believe the US explanations, saying that “it would be very strange if a country like the US, which is supposed to be a No.1 in military power in the world, makes such a mistake.” “The Syrian army was over few hills and the American strikes… came over all these hills and the moment the American planes struck the Syrian army the terrorist came from the same side,” she said. According to Assad’s adviser, it was “obvious to everyone in the field that there was an obvious coordination between the American planes and the terrorists.” She also pointed out the fact that the American planes stopped shelling the area where the Syrian army was as soon as it was occupied by Islamic State militants.

READ MORE: Get rid of it or leave: Russian Parliament approves ban on foreign assets for MPs, top officials “The work to introduce the concept of PEP into Russian law will consist of several stages.

Later we will develop and draft everything else,” Solovyov told reporters. The lawmakers also told the newspaper they had noticed a direct correlation between the number of divorces among elected officials and the recent toughening of Russian anti-corruption laws. According to Solovyov and Pozdnyakov, since the ban on foreign assets for civil servants came into force in 2013 the number of divorces among lower house MPs has surged. In 2011 there were 77 single lawmakers in the 450-seat State Duma, in 2014 the number was 99, and in 2015 it reached 102. The Communists claim that many of the divorced couples continued to live together and therefore the sole purpose of separation was an attempt to bypass the law – which they succeeded in doing. Earlier this year, Russia’s Communist and Liberal Democratic parties drafted bills that forbid people whose relatives are engaged in business activities to assume official posts, and banned children of civil servants from entrepreneurship. The posts that fall under the limitation are described as “senior or head position in a state agency” and also in all cases when the responsibilities of the official include overseeing or control over businesses of his or her relatives.

The evil and disgusting ISIS propaganda video shows why we need to do much more to tackle radicalisation in Britain. https://t.co/fAd73IwloS The balaclava-clad man stands over the kneeling victims clad, who are wearing orange jumpsuits, as he accuses Cameron of being a “slave of the White House, and mule of the Jews” threatening IS with a “handful” of planes. The unidentified executioner strains to emulate the style of Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, who was reportedly killed last November by a drone strike. The speaker then says that IS will invade Britain, claiming that Cameron will do nothing to save those “fighting under his banner on minimum wages.” He illustrates his point by appearing to shoot one of the captives in the head, though with the edit it is unclear if it is he taking the fatal shot. Four other terrorists standing behind each of the hostages then simultaneously unload their guns into the victims. It ends with a small boy in an army uniform shouting “We will kill kuffir [infidels] over there,” and a promise of another video. As is revealed in stilted taped confessions at the start of the clip, two of the executed men say they discreetly filmed footage and took photos in Raqqa, the IS stronghold in northern Syria, which were subsequently shown in the Western media. The other three admit to being paid to provide information to intelligence services.All five men, who say they are between the ages of 25 and 40, call themselves apostates, and ask to be re-admitted into Islam.British intelligence says it is examining the authenticity of the tape, but will not comment on whether the featured victims ever worked undercover for the UK, as is its policy. It is also attempting to figure out the identity of the new executioner through electronic communications. They also will try to determine whether the child in the video is British, or a local coached to say a phrase in English.

It has also recently suffered territorial setbacks, as ground troops in Syria and Iraq have staged successful counter-offensives. ']\n",

He said he had been told by the BBC, for whom he worked at the time, that his reporting of the 1962-1970 struggle by the country’s Biafran minority to secede from Nigeria was biased. He claimed that because his reports were unacceptable to the British state – which armed the Nigerians during the war – his political leanings came under scrutiny. He then decided to cover the war as an independent journalist. “I got my own ticket to Portugal and conned an arms dealer into taking me into Biafra and while I was there someone entered my flat,” the Day of the Jackal author said. “They said to the neighbors that we had concerns for my health ... the door was duly beaten in.” Asked exactly who had kicked his door in, Forsythe said: “It was the BBC. I was told there is a very secretive fellow in the BBC called ‘The Investigator.’” “They were terrified because the BBC had had a correspondent who had defected and it caused a huge scandal. Very, very embarrassing, so just in case there were any other backsliders they had a man to investigate the politics,” he explained. Forsythe, who recently admitted that he himself engaged in intelligence work for the British state while a journalist, had withering words about the UK establishment. He told the audience he preferred “to be an outsider looking in because as far as I can tell most of the establishment are b*stards and I don’t want to join them.” The BBC had been very much a part of the country’s power structures as an arm of the “establishment ... not a news organisation,” he said.

The Forum constituted 275 separate events across 92 venues in Russia’s magnificent Northern capital (its beauty enhanced by seasonal snow and ice) and involved cultural activists and participants from all over the world. On Friday night, at the new Mariinsky Theater, which opened in 2013, a special gala looked back at the Year of Cinema in Russia, and told the story of the renaissance of the Russian film industry. The event began with a welcoming address by President Vladimir Putin\\xa0and also included celebrated British actor Ralph Fiennes, who, speaking in Russian, told how since childhood he had been inspired by Russian culture. ‘Whatever happens in politics, we have deep connection in culture' - actor Ralph Fiennes to RThttps://t.co/ouJCANCJ3X The 125th anniversary of the birth of composer Sergey Prokofiev was commemorated with extracts from Sergey Eisenstein’s 1944 epic movie Ivan the Terrible, for which Prokofiev wrote the score. The fiftieth anniversary of the classic seven-hour long, Oscar-winning Soviet production of War and Peace, for many judges the best film version of Tolstoy’s work, was also marked with a dance and video display. The message from this and other events was evident. Russia remains open to outside influence and is promoting its own culture with a renewed sense of pride and enthusiasm, something that was totally lacking in the morale-sapping years of Boris Yeltsin. Then the film industry and arts were left to sink or swim as the government, and corrupt Western-backed oligarchs plundered the public purse. For instance, the LenFilm studio, which produced so many classics in the Soviet era, is once again thriving, after being near to closure. Under a government program, thousands of small picture houses in towns and villages, originally built by the Communists, have been modernized with the latest cinema technology. However, even though state support for Russian films has increased – it must be said, it’s still way below the level of subsidy the industry received in Soviet times. And there remains the all-important question, what sort of films should Russia be making? There were calls for the government to fund productions more in tune with Russian ’philosophy’ and not just ’Americanized’ blockbusters. The topic of cultural renewal was also covered during a one-day discussion panel held at the 18th century Herzen State Pedagogical University, entitled: ‘National and global culture and education development patterns in the framework of state sovereignty.' The issue of ’language imperialism’ - and attempts to impose a cross-borders cultural hegemony by a few Anglo-Saxon countries was raised by some the distinguished speakers. There was also criticism of the ‘Bologna Process’ which had been designed to try and achieve comparability of academic standards across Europe. Professor Kira V. Preobrazhenskaya complained that for Russian scholars to publish internationally in English-language journals, they have to criticize Russian culture. Vardan E. Bagdasaryan, Chair of History, Political Sciences and Law at Moscow State Regional University, said education and culture were, unfortunately, part of a new ‘war,' and that Anglo-Saxon journals which purport to be ’objective’ are very often biased, promoting a Western-centric view of history and also Russophobia. Dimitri de Kochko, of the Union of Russophones of France, called for Russia to follow the example of Hollywood and the Disney Corporation and do all it could to build Russophone networks as a counter to the prevailing Western Russophobia. He noted that in the current climate in France and elsewhere in the West one can get away with saying racist things about Russians that would get the speaker into serious trouble if said about other ethnicities. Even great Russian writers like Fyodor Dostoyevsky were coming under attack for geopolitical reasons. In my speech, I discussed cultural\\xa0‘dumbing down’\\xa0in the age of neo-liberalism and argued that this process was no accident but a deliberate policy of the West’s ruling elite, who, while keeping the best arts for themselves, wanted to create a population of docile, materialistic consumers. Aldous Huxley had meant Brave New World to be a warning; the powers-that-be seem to be using it as a blueprint. I also contrasted the more balanced cross-border cultural exchanges which took place in the more egalitarian pre-neoliberal era, with today, when Hollywood and other organs of Western\\xa0‘soft power’\\xa0have become far too dominant. To illustrate the point, I read from the BBC television listings from Christmas 1978, which included films and programs from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. Contrast that real internationalism and open-mindedness to today, when rabidly anti-Russian neocons in the West are doing all they can to try and get RT taken off the air, and the programs we see about Russia, outside of RT, are almost always negative. Professor Lubov M. Mosolova, a Doctor of Culturology at Herzen University, warned against having a too narrow view of ‘culture,' saying it includes far more than the arts. We can speak of an engineering culture, an Army culture and the culture of the workplace. The word ‘artists’ needs to be broadened too, as many workers and not just actors, painters, film/theater directors and dancers, are artists. At the end of the day’s proceedings, a resolution was adopted. It noted that globalization entails not only the interpenetration of national cultures but often jeopardized the cultural identity of countries and peoples. The panel put forward some recommendations, which included Russia’s Ministry of Education and Science forming a public-professional expert group on the analysis of the current educational situation and an international youth cultural and education camp being held in St. Petersburg in the summer of 2017. To protect and preserve national heritage and sovereign education systems in the era of globalization certainly presents many challenges but genuine humanitarians, who oppose the elites of a few countries trying to impose a dumbed-down cultural hegemony on others, will have been encouraged by what they saw and heard in St. Petersburg last week. The inspiring and life-enhancing city of Dostoyevsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Shostakovich, as well as of many others, in both the narrower and broader sense referred to by Lubov Mosolova, shows us the way to go.

He had been known to police since 2011 and in 2013 he had been sentenced to three years in prison, with six months suspended, for his role in a recruitment network of Islamist radicals to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Abballa was on a French monitoring list, was under police surveillance and his phone was tapped since February, according to prosecutors, but there were reportedly no signs of an attack being planned. Several right-wing politicians, including Eric Ciotti, a member of Les Republicains [The Republicans] party, urged the French authorities to establish facilities for people with dangerous mental health issues and who are known to police. “We need to deal with the issue of these people who are identified, known [to police] and followed… Abballa was one of those people. Since 2012, I’ve placed multiple propositions to create a closed retention center where all the high-risk, ‘time-bomb’ people could be put,” Ciotti said. The leader of Les Republicains, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, also supported\\xa0a security step-up in prisons in an interview given to Le Figaro newspaper. “We’re at a state of war. It’s an external war against groups [like] ISIS and Al-Qaeda, but also an internal one against those French citizens who support radical Islam,” he said, adding that “jihadism and radical Islamism are our real enemies, and they sustain each other.” The move to open the detention facilities was supported by a Muslim leader, Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. \"Individuals like this are moving around freely in France. This should not last,\" he said.Others like presidential candidate Alain Juppé called for radicalized individuals to be put under house arrest. In his latest comments, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the idea of retention centers could threaten the letter of law. \"Our first weapon is criminal law, and it is the legitimacy of the rule of law: to pursue, detain and put out of harm\\'s way all those who engage in these [jihadist] networks. [It can be] dangerous to confuse measures of surveillance with those of confinement.” “We can learn the lessons of this terrorist threat but we can’t invent new measures each time,” he added. He also defended the security forces, saying in an interview with France Inter radio on Wednesday: “I will not let anyone say there was any negligence or lack of judgment.” A system of detention for suspected Islamists already exists in several French prisons. Several dozen of the most radical inmates are determined by using a set of questions, and they are then grouped together behind bars to prevent them from spreading their ideas. The system has been criticized for uniting the jihadists, though. The latest news comes a day after Belgian security services informed their French counterparts about groups of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) fighters coming to Europe from Syria. \"We know there are fighters who are coming back [to Europe],\" French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told a news conference Wednesday.

Turkish authorities insist all those killed during police raids are terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers party [PKK.] There have also been several reports that Iraqi Kurds have shot down a helicopter which they claim had been used in air strikes against them. RT:\\xa0Turkey seems determined to proceed with its military crackdown despite the outcry from rights groups. Do you think they will admit they killed thousands of civilians? Ronald Suny: I doubt that very much. The fact is that at the moment all over the world, and in Turkey particularly right now, the word ‘terrorist’ has become meaningless – that is, anyone who resists oppression, occupation they are being called ‘terrorists’ nowadays. The people who have been fighting or defending their towns in Diyarbakir, in Cizre have been fighting for autonomy, for some rights. In Kurdistan, that is, in Eastern Turkey, it is impossible for a Kurdish child to be educated in a state school in the Kurdish language. We’re talking about 15 million or more people who cannot study in their own language. This is clearly oppression, it is against national self-determination, and it is extremely reprehensible what the Turkish government has decided to do against its own Kurdish citizens. RT:\\xa0We've seen pictures from the areas under curfew and they literally look like Syria at the moment. How come such heavy military operations are being allowed in residential areas? RS: I think this is really reprehensible. The level of warfare in these internal conflicts is going to new degrees of obscenity, it seems to me: bombing from the air civilian populations in cities where they have really no escape, or in the case of the Cizre, surrounding the town with tanks, shelling the civilians, and the people who are defending the towns, of course they are called ‘militants, terrorists’ or whatever. Sniping from rooftops on people who go out to help other people who have been wounded. These kinds of things have become daily occurrences. It seems at the moment in Cizre the fighting has stopped, the Turkish army has taken over the city. As you saw in Diyarbakir, demonstrations to try to protest what has been going on have also been broken up. So at the very moment it seems that the Turkish government and armed forces have the upper hand in what is essentially a struggle by the Kurds – not for independence, so much - as for some autonomy, some recognition of their existence of their rights within the Turkish state. The image Turkey wants to give to the world, especially to the Kurds, is that they cannot be beaten, the Kurds should submit to them, Kani Xulam of the American Kurdish Information Network, told RT. RT:\\xa0If such an incident took place why do you think the Turkish government is staying quiet about it? Kani Xulam: Well, the Turkish government would like to portray itself as invincible, as a power that cannot be beaten. Throughout the conflict with the Kurds, scores of Turkish soldiers were taken prisoners and the Turkish government would not even acknowledge them for long periods of time. And when there were peace talks these soldiers would be released. About the helicopter incident – in the Turkish media there is no reference to it, but there are some references now in some of the Kurdish dailies about it. But the image Turkey wants to give to the world, especially to the Kurds, is that they cannot be beaten; the Kurds should submit to them, go down on their knees. But this generation of Kurds is not about going down on their knees, they want to fight back, they want to get their rights. RT:\\xa0Turkey has been targeting Kurdish forces in many areas outside the country. Why does it feel entitled to conduct such operations on another states' territory? KH: The problem is the Kurds live in Syria, in Iraq, in Turkey and in Iran. For a long time these countries, even if they didn’t go along on a lot of issues, they will go along on the Kurdish issue. When [Saddam] Hussein was in power, for example, Turkey had a green light, if you will. It could fly into Iraqi Kurdistan and fight the Kurds [Turkish Kurds] at will. With the advent of the Arab Spring things have changed. Any time now, for example, Turkey attacks Kurdish positions inside Iraq, the Arab League condemns it, the Baghdad government condemns it. Turkish–Syrian relations are not good now. So anytime Turkey wants to attack the Kurds inside Syria, the Syrian government condemns it. Their relations lately have become soured, but for a long time they were good. The good part was that the common denominator was that they all didn’t like the Kurds and they wanted the Kurds not to prosper.

According to Reuters the forces are made up of Failaq al Sham, Sultan Murad, Ahrar al-Sham and Jabha al Shamiya units. The assault is expected to begin in the next few days before Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) can retake the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) -held town. A US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters are also making a push towards the border town after taking full control of Manbij by driving IS militants from the strategically important town, used by terrorists to smuggle weapons and goods. The SDF already controls the eastern bank of the Euphrates opposite Jarablus. Ankara has long been worried about the autonomy of Kurds in Syria as Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) of the Democratic Union Party of Syria (PYD) with the help of American-led airstrikes, continue to capture vast amount of territory in Northern Syria, which borders Kurdish-dominant southeastern Turkey, where Ankara has engaged the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK) in a brutal military campaign for over a year. Turkey has repeatedly said that it would not tolerate Kurds staying west of the Euphrates River, with YPG-PYD advances in northern Syria remaining the key security issue for Ankara. The two groups are designated terrorist organizations by Turkey but not the US. Turkey fears that Kurds are trying to link up Afrin canton with its cantons in the east, Kobane and Cizre.

Gray added that “American and British hawks are getting hysterical” due to Clinton being one of the people who are whipping up aggression against Putin. As for the leaks of the DNC and Podesta emails, the Clinton team “are very, very keen to pin the blame on Russia as the [releases by] WikiLeaks are embarrassing to the Democrats. So, if they can say that: ‘Nobody should be talking about this. We shouldn’t give the enemy an advantage,’ obviously that’s advantageous to them,” he said. He stressed that when it comes to cyber security “there does seem to be quite a lot of activity coming from Russia,” but added that the West has no concrete proof against Moscow. Claims that the Russian government is somehow meddling with the outcome of the US presidential election are a manifestation of the same hysteria, Gray said. The journalist predicted that after all of Clinton’s rhetoric about Russia “there’s going to be some kind of showdown over the no-fly zone in Syria. And that’s’ a very frightening prospect.” He said it’s “silly on our part to provoke Putin,” adding that the Russian leader is “going to advance Russia’s national interest and that may mean some sort of confrontation in eastern Europe.” READ MORE: It’s Russia & RT! Team Clinton knows who’s to blame for Podesta leaks Gray expressed the belief that “the more people that can say how hysterical we’re being in the West [about Russia] – the better. And that we were trying to do this week in The Spectator.’” He also commented on the recent attempt to close RT’s bank accounts in UK, saying that such developments pose a “great danger.” “We’re so afraid of these threats to our free society from the East that we’re actually in danger of not being a free society ourselves… I think you do spread propaganda on your channel. I think you do. But we’re a free society and we should allow you to do it,” he said. According to The Spectator deputy editor, Russia and Putin are “winning the information war. It seems his propaganda is rather superior to ours. And we seem to be losing on many fronts.” When asked about the different tone in which the Western media covers similar operations in Mosul by the US-led coalition in Iraq and in Aleppo by Russia in Syria, he said that “there are huge double standards in Western media. There are huge double standards in Eastern media, I’m sure. And even on such an honest channel as RT.” READ MORE: Pro-Hillary US State Dept ‘behind Assange internet cutoff’ – WikiLeaks activist to RT “There’s double standards in Yemen too.

            "['9 Feb, 2016 17:31 ', 'West’s military superiority on global stage withering away – report', 'uk', 'In its latest study, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) found that advances in arms technology that were once the preserve of the West are becoming increasingly accessible to states worldwide. The study, which is titled “Military Balance 2016,” examines the military and defense spending capabilities of 171 countries across the globe. It is released annually by the think tank and is viewed as an important resource in the field of defense and security policy-making. The IISS found that cruise missiles, unmanned drones and technology used for the purpose of electronic warfare are no longer accessible merely to Western states, but have also become available to governments worldwide. The report said the number of states known to operate unmanned drones had doubled since 2011, with China exporting them to allied states such as Iraq and Nigeria. The report went on to make a number of controversial claims about Russian, Asian and NATO defense spending. It said a rise in the Kremlin’s defense budget for 2015 sparked a 20 percent increase in military spending worldwide, while Asia spends almost $100 billion more on defense than NATO’s European members.\\xa0 The report also noted the number of army battalions in the most prominent NATO states and in America had plunged from 649 to 185 since 2001. Meanwhile, British combat aircraft numbers were found to have fallen from 475 to 194 since 1991, while French warplanes were found to have plummeted from 579 to 271. Speaking at a London press conference, IISS Director General John Chipman warned the West’s 20-year military superiority in technological terms is dwindling. “Slowing this emerging trend or reversing it will be a key preoccupation of Western strategists in the coming decade,” he said. The IISS report said Britain is attempting to remain ahead of the curve by developing a solar-powered surveillance drone, while the US is working on sophisticated electronics for unmanned aerial vehicles. “ISIS [Islamic State/IS, also known as ISIL], and the groups around the world that have pledged allegiance to it, cannot be eradicated solely by military means,” the report said. “Tackling these groups will require multinational attention and the concerted and long-term application of policies and tools blending political, military, security, information, and development capacities, and agreement on ends as well as means.” ']\n",
            "['14 Feb, 2016 15:14 ', 'Why the Syria ceasefire is a long shot', 'op-edge', 'In short, Washington and its allies want regime change, while Russia and Iran insist that President Bashar Assad and his government are the legitimate ruling authorities in Syria. All sides are mandated by UN resolutions to respect the sovereign will of the Syrian people – to determine the political future of their country. But the Western powers and their regional partners, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar in particular, are insisting – explicitly or implicitly – on their objective of ousting Assad. This premise of unlawful interference in the affairs of a sovereign state is the crux of the problem, and why the latest seeming agreement for a nationwide truce is as thin as the paper it is written on. US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\\xa0announced\\xa0the proposal for a cessation of hostilities following six hours of negotiations with 15 other member states belonging to the International Syria Support Group in Munich last Friday. The truce is supposed to come into effect later this week. The truce outlined in an ISSG communique does not apply to two militant groups: Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIL/ISIL or Daesh) and the Jabhat al Nusra Front. Both are linked to Al Qaeda and are officially listed by international governments as terrorist organizations. The provision also exempts “other terror groups” but does not specify the names. This is a major loophole in the proposed truce deal which will make its application extremely problematic if not infeasible. That loophole also alludes to the foreign-backed nature of the conflict in Syria. Following the Munich communique, the Syrian government and its Russian ally both said that their combined military operations against terror groups would continue. President Assad\\xa0vowed\\xa0that his armed forces were moving ahead with their offensive, backed by Russian air power, to “retake the whole country.” He said the battle for the northern city of Aleppo – the country’s largest – was crucial to “cut off terrorist supply routes from Turkey.” Given the delineation of terror groups in the Munich communique and in recent UN resolutions (2249 and 2254), it would appear incontestable that the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies have every right to maintain the military momentum. Yet Syria and Russia’s continued offensive around Aleppo over the weekend provoked recriminations from Western powers. Western media coverage tended to portray the continuation of military operations as a bad faith breach of the tentative truce. Reuters\\xa0news agency reported:\\xa0“Russia keeps bombing despite Syria truce; Assad vows to fight on.” Secretary Kerry expressed irritation when he\\xa0said: “If the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made... then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this. There will be an increase of activity to put greater pressure on them.” BREAKING UPDATE: Damascus confirms its army targeted by Turkey shelling https://t.co/ELk2n32dNSpic.twitter.com/2TyXsMmsY7 Kerry even warned that\\xa0“greater pressure”\\xa0could involve foreign troops being sent into Syria, without naming from which countries, saying: “There is a possibility there will be additional ground troops.” The top American diplomat made the comments while attending the Munich Security Conference along with several world leaders, held the day after the truce deal was brokered by the ISSG. Kerry told\\xa0delegates ominously:\\xa0“We hope this week can be a week of change. This moment is a hinge point. Decisions made in the coming days, weeks and months can end the war in Syria. Or, if the wrong choices are made, they can open the door to even wider conflict.” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also addressed the Munich conference, but he warned that any ground invasion in Syria by foreign forces ran the grave risk of unleashing an all-out war. Over the weekend, it was reported\\xa0that Saudi F-16 warplanes are to begin flying out of Turkey’s NATO base at Incirlik, allegedly on combat operations against the Islamic State terror group in Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that a combined Saudi-Turkish ground force was ready to intervene in Syria, and there were reports of cross-border Turkish artillery shelling of Syrian Kurdish sites. The nub of the proposed truce is that Syria and Russia are legally entitled to eradicate ISIS, Al Nusra and related groups. Strategically, too, it can be argued that the defeat of such illegally armed insurgents is a priority task in creating conditions for an end to the five-year conflict. However,\\xa0“the related terror groups”\\xa0also include many other militants whom Western governments and Western media mendaciously refer to as\\xa0“moderate rebels.”\\xa0So, while the Syrian Arab Army and Russian fighter planes can legitimately make the case that these groups are to be targeted, Washington and its allies will deceptively allege that Moscow is attacking\\xa0“moderate rebels.” This is a risible fiction constructed by Western governments, their regional partners and the Western media. It is well documented that groups like Jaish al-Islam, Jaish al-Fateh, Ahrar al-Sham and Farouq Brigade – heavily sponsored by Saudi Arabia and Qatar – are integrated with the officially recognized Al Qaeda terrorist organizations. Even the so-called\\xa0“secular”\\xa0Free Syrian Army – much championed by Washington – is in league with ISIS and Al Nusra, as are the Turkmen brigades openly\\xa0supported\\xa0by the Turkish government. US government-owned news outlet Voice of America\\xa0described\\xa0the terror-rebel connection in the following delicate way:\\xa0“The Munich deal writes out any cessation of hostilities for not only the Islamic State but [al Qaeda] affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra or other groups deemed terrorists by the UN Security Council. Some of those groups, aside from IS, have been battlefield allies of other rebel factions around Aleppo.” ‘Turkey wants to stop Kurds liberating northern Syria from ISIS’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/V3P6EmxQoApic.twitter.com/2PCkZoMcYB Meanwhile, the Washington Post admitted\\xa0that Jabhat al-Nusra “in some instances fights alongside rebel forces supported by the United States and its allies.” The Post article added that even in the event of a truce taking hold: “The United States and its partners would continue their current level of equipping and training the opposition so as not to leave the rebels at a disadvantage if the cessation of hostilities collapses.” The cessation that Washington has assiduously tried to craft is not premised on finding a genuine end to the conflict. Rather, it is evidently a tactical pause to afford proxy forces on the ground badly needed respite from the Syrian-Russian onslaught. That onslaught is threatening to wipe out the myriad terror- and terrorist-related brigades. That’s why John Kerry has been so concerned to stymie Russia’s intervention. That intervention ordered by President Vladimir Putin less than five months ago is wiping out terror assets that Washington and its allies have invested in for regime change in Syria over five years. That investment is going up in smoke, and that is also why Washington and its regional partners Turkey and Saudi Arabia are reserving a direct military contingency – in order to salvage their regime-change project. The proposed cessation in Syria is a long shot that will miss the mark of bringing peace to the war-devastated country. Because Washington and its allies are not interested in peace. They want regime change – by hook or by crook. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. ']\n",

Earlier this week Kiev’s EconomicCourt sanctioned a move by Ukraine’s Anti-monopoly committee to fine Gazprom $6.6 billion, including over $170 million in penalties. The ruling alleged that Gazprom had abused its monopoly position in the natural gas market in 2009-2015. “In our view, it is an absolutely illegal decision, as it was not implemented by the Stockholm court,” Novak countered. The International Court of Arbitration in Stockholm is tasked with settling problems involving international business deals.According to Novak, the Kiev court ruling poses “new risks for gas transit to European customers since Ukraine can adopt the [decree on] imposition of penalties corresponding to the fine.” The energy minister said that he was surprised\\xa0by Kiev’s claims, since Gazprom has no business on Ukrainian territory, with Russian gas being handled there by the country’s Naftogaz. Warning of the possible risk to Europe due to Ukraine’s decision, Novak issued letters to the deputy head of EU Commission on energy and respective European customers. Supplies of Russian gas to Ukraine, as well as its transit to Europe for the winter period were discussed Friday in Brussels. According to Novak, Ukraine signaled its readiness to purchase up to 4 billion cubic meters of gas from Moscow, with no “controversy” on the price tag. \"Ukraine has expressed readiness to buy between 1.5 and 4 billion cubic meters of gas for winter to ensure a reliable supply to Ukrainian consumers and for transit to European consumers,” the Minister said. He added that according to two contracts (valid until 2019 and 2020 respectively) Russia “is ready to provide reliable deliveries” to all of the sides. Yet no deal or other documents have been signed as of yet, participants of the meeting in Brussels announced. Kiev is staunchly linking the signature of the respective deal to certain amendments which it proposed for the agreement. According to the Ukrainian side, it would eliminate certain risks for Kiev. “Today we did not manage to sign an additional agreement. According to the contract between Naftogaz and Gazprom, purchases of gas by Gazprom are impossible without it,” Naftogaz chief, Andrey Kobelev, told reporters. Yet both sides have agreed to continue talks to settle the issue. Russia and Ukraine have been involved in numerous gas conflicts over the past years, raising concerns in Europe as well.

And it will be the same with Poland,” Putin said during a joint press conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens on Friday. The Russian President was referring to the Deveselu facility that officially became operational in May after nearly a decade and $800 million of planning and construction. “At the moment the interceptor missiles installed have a range of 500 kilometers, soon this will go up to 1000 kilometers, and worse than that, they can be rearmed with 2400km-range offensive missiles even today, and it can be done by simply switching the software, so that even the Romanians themselves won’t know,” said Putin, who is in Greece for a two-day tour. “We have the capability to respond. The whole world saw what our medium-range sea-based missiles are capable of [in Syria]. But we violate no agreements. And our ground-based Iskander missiles have also proven themselves as superb,” continued Putin. Russia’s political and military leadership has repeatedly spoken out against the missile defense shield since it was proposed during the George W. Bush administration, and Putin reiterated that Moscow does not believe the European part of it is targeted against a potential threat from Iran. “NATO fend us off with vague statements that this is no threat to Russia… That the whole project began as a preventive measure against Iran’s nuclear program. Where is that program now? It doesn’t exist,” said Putin, referring to the nuclear treaty that was concluded between the world’s major powers and Tehran last year. “We have been saying since the early 2000s that we will have to react somehow to your moves to undermine international security. No one is listening to us.” Alexis Tsipras in his turn reiterated that Russia is a player in the European security theater and that current attempts to alienate Moscow with measures such as sanctions reminds him of Cold War times. “European security cannot be achieved without cooperation and dialogue with Russia,” Tsipras said in an interview with Sputnik. “I don't believe that we can move forward or ensure compliance with international law while caught in a vicious circle of sanctions, militarization and Cold War rhetoric.” President Putin arrived in Greece on Friday for a two-day visit that involves meetings with his Greek counterpart, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and other top-level discussions. It is the Russian president’s first EU trip in seven months, and comes just weeks before Brussels decides on whether to extend EU sanctions against Russia. Bilateral trade and investment, as well as joint energy and transport projects, were said to be major issues on the agenda for the visit. Another pressing matter for both Athens and Moscow, the economic sanctions against Russia, will also be on the table. Prime Minister Tsipras has already told RIA Novosti that the restrictions have had a negative impact on Russian-Greek economic ties, but added there are areas not covered by the sanctions where business between the two countries could perform well. The Greek PM laid a foundation of trust with the Russian leader and even proposed a visa-free travel regime in the EU for Russian nationals. “We overcame all the difficulties that arose due to changes in the issuance of Schengen visas, strengthened the work of our consulates in Russia by attracting dozens of new employees, and we are ready to meet the high demand of Russian nationals for travel to Greece. At the same time, I find it necessary, as I have already mentioned at a European level, that dialogue is relaunched on easing the visa regime for Russian citizens,” Tsipras said. Promoting international security and tackling illegal migration, which is the hot issue in Greece, are also points of mutual interest. On Saturday, President Putin will attend a prayer service at Mount Athos, which is home to 20 monasteries and is an important spiritual site for Orthodox Christians. Joined by Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, the president is expected to take part in millennial celebrations of the Russian monastic presence on Athos.     \"]\n",

MI6 has been embroiled in scandals in recent years, including allegations that the agency rendered Libyan dissenters to Tripoli, where they were tortured by the Gaddafi regime.

His bereaved father described to RT his awe at the staggering success of the Iraq War Families Campaign’s crowdfunding drive to fund a full legal examination of the Chilcot Report for evidence challenging the legality of the war. The online fundraiser hit its first target of £50,000 (US$66,000) within a day of launching on Tuesday, and it is now rapidly approaching its secondary target of £150,000. Roger said the funds are needed to hire a “firm of lawyers to look at the Iraq report, to see just what kind of illegalities or misuse of constitutional powers have taken place.” He recognized Sir John Chilcot’s long-delayed report, published on July 6, is “not a legal document, and that the legality of going to war would have to be decided in a properly constituted and recognized court.” Bacon said the families of the 179 troops killed in the war are “really relieved about the report itself. It says all we thought it should say, but we do actually need to find out the legality of it because that is the only way of making sure if there has been anything that transgresses the law.” “It is the only way of making sure that what happened in Iraq never happens again,” he added. “Matthew was a soldier’s soldier, he loved the soldiering life, and by the time he went to Iraq he was a major in the Intelligence Corps,” Bacon said of his late 34-year-old son. The consensus among the families, for whom Roger has been a regular spokesman, is “we did not think we should have gone into Iraq in the first place, we are also concerned, of course, about some of the equipment failures, which had resulted partially because of the lack of planning at the beginning.” Much of the controversy around Iraq, he said, “goes back to some of the decisions made by Tony Blair in taking us up to the war.” He pointed out that with the International Criminal Court (ICC) not yet able to rule on war crimes, criminal charges unlikely, and no indication from the government or parliament that “punitive action” will be taken, “the only recourse we have left is to take civil proceedings in this country.” The result of civil action, Bacon acknowledged, would be compensation, which he said the families were not “particularly interested” in. “But the advantage of that is that we can then use it to somehow give back to the Iraqi people, to do something to improve their lives,” he said.

The court judgment ruled that internet search engines are responsible for the “processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties.” It gives Europeans the right to ask the search engines to delist links about them that are inaccurate or outdated. To implement the ruling, an individual must submit the URL they want to delist through Google\\'s webform. If the internet giant deems the request meets the criteria of the European Court, then Google will delist the URL from the search results. Since May 2014, Google says\\xa0it has evaluated 1,400,006 URLs, removing slightly over 42 percent of the URLs. Up until now Google has received 397,502 requests from European internet users. The largest number of requests came from France, with over 84,000, followed by Germany with some 68,000, and the UK with close to 49,000 requests. ']\n",

RT spoke with author and historian Gerald Horne for his opinion on these sentiments and what they mean for global politics. RT: In her latest interview to NYT, Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of the US going as far as to call the country \"exceptional\" and \"indispensable\". What are your thoughts on that? Gerald Horne: Well, I would suggest that Secretary Clinton take lessons from President Barack Obama, who was asked if he believed that the United States was an exceptional country. He said yes, but he also said he\\'s sure that the British leadership feels that Britain is an exceptional country, that the Greek leadership feels that Greece is an exceptional country and on down the line. I think that Secretary Clinton must realize that, and so when she goes down that road, about so-called American exceptionalism, what she\\'s really trying to do is provide a rationale and an argument for US hegemony and US domination of the world. RT: During one of her rallies this year the Democratic candidate explicitly accused Vladimir Putin of raising the popularity of ‘extreme nationalism’. Do you think her stance on the Russian leader goes at odds with her recent statement? GH: She gives away the game when she talks about the so-called alliances, the military alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which lost its reason for being when the Soviet Union collapsed, but continues plotting along nonetheless and is moving ever closer to the borders of Russia, which is a direct provocation. When she talks about US exceptionalism, I would also urge her to go to her history books and study about the dispossession of the Native Americans and the enslavement of the Africans, which formed the foundation of this country. If she ingested and digested those lessons, I think she would be much less inclined to talk about so-called US exceptionalism. ‘American exceptionalism is a Rorschach test meaning anything you want it to be’ (Op-Edge by @LionelMedia) https://t.co/moJ0qspqaf RT: The idea of exceptionalism is something Hillary Clinton also dismisses as a part of the US patriotism, yet many deem it to be a flimsy comparison. What\\'s your take on that? GH: Well, it\\'s very odd for Secretary Clinton to be talking about extreme nationalism. If you read those words that forms the basis for our conversation, you could easily conclude that the word chauvinism, which is actually a French derivation, might be of US derivation. That is to say, her words reeked with US national chauvinism, so it\\'s rather odd that she would accuse another leader of what she is actually guilty of. RT: Boosting patriotism through imposing the ideas of being superior to other nations seemed like a worrying trend to quite a few people on social media, with some of the users even bringing up the policies of Adolf Hitler as an example. How fair is this comparison, in your opinion? GH: Well, to repeat the United States is an exceptional nation. It\\'s exceptional in its level of violence, particularly in terms of the founding of this so-called republic. It\\'s exceptional in its level of racism, particularly towards black people as reflected in police killings that have pot marked the landscape on a regular basis for months if not years now, so yes, she is correct when she talks about US exceptionalism. The problem is that she\\'s looking through the wrong end of the telescope. 3 rules of US Exceptionalism: 1) Our killing is better than theirs; 2) Nothing we do can be \"terrorism\"; 3) Only enemies are \"war criminals\" RT: The US exceptionalism can be also seen through the role of the \"international police\" the country has long assumed. GH: Let\\'s put it this way. Like many people in North America right now, I\\'m very much concerned about the prospect of war right now. When Secretary Clinton talks about establishing a no-fly zone in Syria, she is basically saying that if she\\'s sworn in to the highest office in the land, in January 2017, she will be challenging Russian jets over Syria. This is a direct provocation. It could easily devolve into World War III. I\\'m very much concerned about the hawkish language coming out of Washington that in a very cavalier fashion is talking about confronting and challenging Moscow, a major nuclear power. This is insanity. This is lunacy. This is extremely dangerous. The United States styles itself as the police officer of planet Earth. The problem is no one has appointed the United States to be the police officer of planet Earth. I would advise Secretary Clinton as I would advise others in Washington that they should take their demands and their claims to the United Nations Security Council and United Nations New York and hash them out there, and come to a compromise, rather than unilaterally seeking to impose their diktat all over the world, most recently in Syria.

Speaking to private broadcaster TVN24 last week, Zalewska refused to openly admit the involvement of Polish citizens in the massacres of Jews in the town of Jedwabne in 1941, in which more than 300 Jews were burned alive inside a barn, and in Kielce in 1946, in which 42 Jews were shot by Polish police. \"Jedwabne is a historical fact that has led to many misunderstandings and very biased opinions,\" Zalewska said on July 13, adding that “the dramatic situation which took place in Jedwabne is controversial. Many historians, distinguished professors, paint a completely different picture,” as quoted by Reuters. On Kielce, she said the perpetrators were anti-Semites, \"but not quite Polish.\" Following Zalewska’s remarks, Jedwabne mayor Chajewski issued a statement calling for an exhumation of mass graves in Jedwabne “to see if the victims had been killed by German soldiers.” In a statement\\xa0issued on Wednesday, Lauder called Zalewska’s remarks and Chajewski’s subsequent calls to exhume the remains of the Jedwabne massacre victims “disturbing” and a “slap in the face” of Holocaust survivors. He also insisted that the two officials immediately issued clearly-worded apologies and retracted their remarks. He also advised the two politicians to follow the suit of the Polish President Andrzej Duda, who earlier strongly condemned anti-Semitism at multiple state observances that marked massacres in Jedwabne and Kielce. “Minister Zalewska and Mayor Chajewski would do well to heed the words of President Andrzej Duda who said earlier this month at the 70th anniversary of the Kielce pogrom that ‘In a free, sovereign and independent Poland there is no room for any form of prejudice. There is no room for racism, for xenophobia, for anti-Semitism’,” Lauder said. \"It is disturbing to think that senior government officials in Poland, a country that ... has done so much to advance the cause of Holocaust education and scholarship, now seem to be lurching backward to the days of obfuscation and misinformation,\" he added. He also stressed that the two politicians undermined the efforts of Polish scholars,\\xa0“who have spent more than 25 years unearthing evidence of horrifying acts of violence against Jews committed by Poles.” Earlier, Zalewska’s remarks also provoked a wave of indignation from various activist groups and Jewish communities. Rafal Pankowski, the head of Never Again, a Polish anti-racism organization, told AP on July 14 that his group was \"appalled by those comments which amount to denial of the historical truth about anti-Semitic pogroms.\" Poland’s Jewish community “is stunned and hurt by the words of the Minister of Education,” Polish chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said following the minister’s remarks. Polish society has long avoided discussions about the killings of Jews, committed by Polish people during and after World War II. A turning point was the 2001 publication of the book “Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland” by a Polish-American sociologist, Jan Tomasz Gross, who said that about 1,600 Jews were killed in the town. The publication was followed by an investigation by Poland\\'s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), which concluded that Gross\\'s estimate of 1,600 victims \"seems highly unlikely” and put the death toll at about 340 people. At the same time, it confirmed that local inhabitants were involved in the Jedwabne massacre. The massacres of Jews committed by the Poles are also a controversial issue for the ruling Law and Justice Party that promised to make Poland proud of its history and achievements. The WJC’s demand for an apology comes just a day after Polish parliament approved the assignment of Jaroslaw Szarek to the post of the head of the IPN, which investigated the killings in Jedwabne. Szarek earlier said that the Jedwabne massacre was a crime committed by the Nazi occupiers, who \"forcibly used a group of Poles in (their) machine of terror,” as he spoke to a parliamentary committee, Polish PAP news agency reports.

The Pirate party, founded in 2012, ran on the platform of promise to get rid of the 72-year-old constitution and replace it with a “crowd-sourced” document. It also promised to hold a possible referendum on joining the European Union. Taking advantage of public anger following the Panama Papers scandal in April and acting on fears of perceived political corruption in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, the Pirate Party offered full governmental transparency, individual freedoms and the fight against corruption. The Pirates seek to decriminalize drugs and introduce a policy of offering asylum to whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.

Following Saturday’s strong result, Iceland’s Pirate Party may become the world’s first Pirate movement to be included in a government coalition.

There is no genetics there, Evgeny Nishchuk said on Monday in an interview with local local TV channel ICTV when asked why Ukrainian culture is spreading so slowly. The comment was quickly noticed both inside and outside Ukraine. The Opposition Bloc party forwarded a plea to the Ukrainian parliament to make Nishchuk give up his office, saying that “societies based on ethnical segregation have long been outdated” and “he would be punished for this kind of comments in a civilized society.” “The minister points to ethnically unclean people who are, however, still providing for Ukraine’s economics and national budget,” the party’s statement said. The leader of Ukraine’s Radical Party, Oleg Lyashko, harshly condemned Nishchuk on his Facebook page and didn’t hesitate to call him “an idiot,” who should be fired as a “genetically impaired” person. Ukraine’s energy minister, Igor Nasalik, was less emotional, but still disapproving. “He was talking history, that I understand … but I don’t share his viewpoint,” Nasalik said, according to local news outlet Strana. Nishchuk apologized at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, explaining that he “didn’t want to offend anybody” and he was talking about “the importance of culture dialogue and exchange”. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, made statements about rebels living in the Donbass region, which has been in an armed conflict with the Ukrainian government ever since it came to power in the 2014 Kiev coup. “I doubt that any of our western partners would take these words as an offense,” Maria Zakharova wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday. “Most probably they won’t see them at all. They pay so much attention to human rights. And they pay so little when it comes to politically troublesome regions,” Zakharova noted. It\\'s no surprise it\\'s so hard to stick to the Minsk roadmap to peace in Ukraine, given that “Ukraininan governments see Donbass residents as culturally different people whose identity should be corrected,” Zakharova wrote. Earlier this month the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forced said that people in Donbass harbor extreme hatred for Ukraine’s security officials, adding that they passed information about their locations over to rebel fighters. In August, Viktoria Syumar, deputy secretary of Ukraine\\'s Security Council, suggested holding a nationwide referendum on whether it was worth fighting for control over Donbass, saying it that would take too much in terms of resources to restore the infrastructure there and besides, and that the local population \"hates Ukraine.\" Before that, in June, Vadim Chernysh, Minister for Temporarily Occupied Territories (the official description of the Donbass area, which Kiev says was invaded by Russia), said that even if Donbass is brought back under Ukraine\\'s control, its residents still won’t acknowledge the official Ukrainian government.

By acquiescing, the EU is diluting its once cherished ‘values.\\' In the long term, it may be signing its own death warrant. By making dirty deals with Erdogan, Brussels’ emboldens ‘illiberal’ politicians on Europe’s fringes to resist its authority. Hungary and Poland’s current leaders must be rubbing their hands with glee. And make no mistake, Friday’s transaction between the EU and Turkey was a dirty deal. Ankara has\\xa0agreed that migrants arriving to the EU after Sunday can be sent back. In return, Turkey can release a properly registered migrant from its own territory to the EU. The number is capped at 72,000. A figure that seems to have been pulled from the ether. While the arrangement sounds reasonably straightforward in theory, it’s difficult to envisage how it can succeed in practice. There are already over 45,000 migrants stranded in Greece alone. Despite pleas from Angela Merkel for all EU members to\\xa0accept their ‘fair share’ of people, only 937 have found a new home so far. Thus, the ultimate result of Friday’s accord will most likely be that another 72,000 souls are thrown into a Greek purgatory. This scenario will - hypothetically at least - prevent them moving north to Germany, Sweden and Austria, for example. Naturally, that’s the whole point of this murky understanding. In return, Brussels has agreed to speed up the disbursement of €3 billion to Ankara. It has also offered ‘re-energized’ talks on EU membership. Germany wanted to give more concessions in that regard. But Cyprus, with a considerable amount of its territory occupied by Turkey (and the UK), objected. In reality, Erdogan has no desire to join the EU. If Ankara did become a full member, it would presumably have to revert to genuine democracy. Doing so would loosen Erdogan’s totalitarian grip on power. Instead, what Erdogan really wants is for Western Europe’s elite to legitimize his regime. His strategy is working. The same politicians who endlessly rant and rave about \\'values\\' are now bowing to a thug who has reversed the long celebrated reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Make no mistake, Turkey, long an oasis of modernity in a troubled Middle East, is going backwards at an alarming rate. Erdogan reportedly\\xa0said on Wednesday, in Ankara, “democracy, freedom and the rule of law… for us, these words have absolutely no value any longer.” Just imagine if a leader less valuable to current western strategy made such a statement? For example, Vladimir Putin or Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff? There’d be venom spat all over the op-ed pages from The New York Times to Le Monde and Die Welt. But when a NATO member’s president spouts such things, the same newspapers don\\'t even report the comments. Erdogan didn’t stop there. He also said Turkey will “strike Kurds everywhere.” These are the same Kurds that America (and Russia, too) has partnered with in the war against ISIS. Yet, the US government seems oblivious to Erdogan\\'s words. ‘Turkey leveraging refugees to get what it wants’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/4o7LV0shvFpic.twitter.com/T6UfIx3ybA According to the CPJ (Committee to Protect Journalists), in 2013, Turkey had\\xa0jailed more members of the media than China (40 against 32). For the record, Russia was held responsible for two cases and the USA one. The only EU state included was Italy, also with one. Now, you’d imagine that freedom of the press is a core “European value,” but even their colleagues in the western media don’t make noise about the oppression of Turkish journalists. Across government and the establishment press, there seems to be an understanding that you cannot criticize Turkey. That’s because everybody is afraid to upset Erdogan. If this bully doesn’t get what he wants, he can flood Europe with migrants. And Jihadis. Not only that, if Turkey withdrew from NATO, the US would lose vital military bases it needs to dominate the Middle East. Erdogan has them all over a barrel. And he knows it. He must enjoy watching them squirm. Aside from these issues, it’s very doubtful that Friday’s arrangement will prove effective anyway. The Turkey-EU transaction gave Greece 48 hours to build a functioning asylum system and a court to hear challenges against returns. Considering that Strasbourg\\xa0says (MSS v Belgium and Greece) that Greece has not had a functioning asylum system for ten years, this seems a trifle optimistic. Not to mention that one particular legal issue could derail the whole project. EU member states have not been able to send asylum seekers back to Greece, since a 2011 court ruling which\\xa0found that migrants suffered “degrading treatment” and faced inadequate processes that meant they were at risk of being sent back to countries where they faced persecution. Ultimately, even if Greece somehow manages to control of the situation, and Erdogan keeps his word, where will these migrants eventually go? To the UK perhaps? It has already\\xa0given $1.7 billion to refuges in Syria. But London won’t take them in. Meanwhile, the only two countries who were willing to take masses of migrants last year, Germany and Sweden, have cried “enough.\" Right now, it’s impossible to predict how this gigantic mess will ever be resolved. Yet, to paraphrase an old Irish expression, “If I was trying to get there, I wouldn’t start from here.” There are many potential losers in this crisis. Brussels, Merkel and thousands of innocent migrants being the most obvious. Nevertheless, there’s one surefire winner - Erdogan. He’s got the EU wrapped around his finger. And he knows it.

            "['22 May, 2016 13:05 ', 'Beware what you wish for: Russia is ready for war', 'op-edge', 'Global Robocop NATO predictably discussed Afghanistan (a war NATO ignominiously lost); Iraq (a war the Pentagon ignominiously lost); Libya (a nation NATO turned into a failed state devastated by militia hell); Syria (a nation NATO, via Turkey, would love to invade, and is already a militia hell). Afghans must now rest assured that NATO’s Resolute Support mission – plus “financial support for Afghan forces” – will finally assure the success of Operation Enduring Freedom forever. Libyans must be reassured, in the words of NATO figurehead secretary Jens Stoltenberg, that we “should stand ready to support the new Government of National Accord in Libya.” And then there’s the icing on the NATO cake, described as\\xa0“measures against Russia”. Stoltenberg duly confirmed, “We have already decided to enhance our forward presence in the eastern part of our alliance. Our military planners have put forward proposals of several battalions in different countries in the region. No decision has been taken on the numbers and locations.” These puny “several battalions” won’t cause any Russian planner to lose sleep. The real “measure” is the\\xa0deployment of the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week – plus a further one in Poland in 2018. This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s. NATO’s argument that the Aegis represents protection against the “threat” of ballistic missiles from Iran does not even qualify as kindergarten play. Every Russian military planner knows the Aegis is not defensive. This is a serious game-changer – as in de-localizing US nuclear capability to Eastern Europe. No wonder Russian President Vladimir Putin had to make it clear Russia would respond “adequately” to any threat to its security. Predictably all Cold War 2.0 hell broke loose, all over again. A former NATO deputy commander went ballistic, while saner heads\\xa0wondered whether Moscow, sooner rather than later, would have had enough of these shenanigans and prepare for war. A case can be made that the Beltway – neocons and neoliberalcons alike - do not want a hot war with Russia. What they want, apart from racking in more cash for the Pentagon, is to raise the ante to such a high level that Moscow will back down - based on a rational cost analysis. Yet oil prices will inevitably rise later in 2016 – and under this scenario Washington is a loser. So we may see a raise of interest rates by the Fed (with all the money continuing to go to Wall Street) trying to reverse the scenario. Comparisons of the current NATO buildup to pre-WWII buildups, or to NATO when opposed to the Warsaw Pact, are amateurish. The THAAD and Patriot missiles are worthless - according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) themselves; that’s why they tried to improve them with Iron Dome. Meanwhile, those new NATO army “battalions” are inconsequential. The basic thrust behind the Pentagon’s moves under neocon Ash Carter continues to be to draw Russia ever further into Syria and Ukraine (as if Moscow actually was involved in, or wanted, a Ukrainian quagmire); trap Russia in proxy wars; and economically bleed Russia to death while crippling the bulk of oil and natural gas income to the Russian state. Russia does not want – and does not need – war. Yet the “Russian aggression” narrative never stops. Thus it’s always enlightening to come back to this RAND corporation study, which examined what would happen if a war actually took place. RAND reached an “unambiguous” conclusion after a series of war games in 2015-2015; Russia could overrun NATO in a mere 60 hours – if not less – if it ever amounted to a hot war on European soil. The Rand Corporation is essentially a CIA outpost – thus a propaganda machine. Yet it’s not propaganda to state the Baltic States and Ukraine would completely fall in less than three days before the Russian Army. However, the suggestion that additional NATO air power and heavily armored combat divisions would make a material difference is bogus. The Aegis changes the game in the sense that it qualifies as a launch area for US missile defense. Think US missiles with minimum flying time – around 30 minutes – from Moscow; that’s a certified threat to the Russian nation. The Russian military has also been “unambiguous”; if it is ascertained that NATO – via the Pentagon – is about to try something funny, there are grounds for a preventive strike by Iskander-M systems out of Transnistria – as in the destruction of the US missiles by conveniently armed precision weapons. Meanwhile, Moscow has pulled a stunning success – of course, it’s far from over – in Syria. So what’s left for the Pentagon – via NATO – is essentially to play the scare tactics card. They know Russia is prepared for war – certainly much better prepared than NATO. They know neither Putin nor the Russian military will back down because of kindergarten scaremongering. As for a too conciliatory tone by the Kremlin towards Washington, things may be about to\\xa0change soon. The Russian military are about to\\xa0test the first prototypes of the S-500 Prometey air and missile defense system, also known as 55R6M Triumfator M – capable of destroying ICBMs, hypersonic cruise missiles and planes at over Mach 5 speeds; and capable of detecting and simultaneously attacking up to ten ballistic missile warheads at a range of 1300 km. This means the S-500 can smash ballistic missiles before their warheads re-enter the atmosphere. Russian Navy ‘Zircon’ hypersonic missile ‘likely’ to go into production as early as 2018 https://t.co/PxeXQBrKp0pic.twitter.com/JsE7Y2WZns So in the case of RAND-style NATO pussyfooting, the S-500 would totally eliminate all NATO air power over the Baltic States – while the advanced Kornet missile would destroy all NATO armored vehicles. And that’s not even\\xa0considering conventional weapon hell. If push comes to nuclear shove, the S-400 and especially the S-500 anti-missile missiles would block all incoming US ICBMs, cruise missiles and stealth aircraft. Offensive drones would be blocked by drone defenses. The S-500 practically consigns to the dustbin stealth warplanes such as the F-22, F-35 and the B-2. The bottom line is that Russia – in terms of hypersonic missile development – is about four generations ahead of the US, if we measure it by the development of the S-300, S-400 and S-500 systems. As a working hypothesis, we could describe the next system – already in the drawing boards – as the S-600. It would take the US military at least ten years to develop and roll out a new weapons system, which in military terms represents a generation. Every Pentagon planner worth his pension plan should know that. Russian – and Chinese – missiles are already able to knock out the satellite guidance systems for US nuclear tipped ICBMs and cruise missiles. They could also knock out the early alert warnings that the satellite constellations would give. A Russian hypersonic ICBM flight time, launched for instance from a Russian nuclear sub all the way to the US East Coast, counts for less than 20 minutes. So an early warning system is absolutely critical. Don’t count on the worthless THAAD and Patriot to do their job. Once again, Russian hypersonic technology has already\\xa0rendered the entire missile defense system in both the US and Europe totally obsolete. So why is Moscow so worried by the Pentagon placing the Aegis system so close to Russia’s borders? A credible answer is that Moscow is always concerned that the US industrial military-complex might develop some really effective anti-missile missiles even though they are now about four generations behind. At the same time, Pentagon planners have reasons to be very worried by what they know, or hint. At the same time the Russian military – in a very Asian way – never reveal their full hand. The key fact of the matter needs to be stressed over and over again; the S-500 is impenetrable - and allows Russia for the first time in history to launch a first strike nuclear attack, if it ever chooses to do so, and be immune to retaliation. The rest is idle babbling. Still, expect the official Pentagon/NATO narrative to remain the same. After all, the industrial-military complex is a cash-devouring hydra, and a powerful enemy is a must (the phony Daesh “caliphate” does not count). The Threat Narrative rules that Russia has to meekly accept being surrounded by NATO. Russia is not allowed any response; in any case, any response will be branded as “Russian aggression”. If Russia defends itself, this will be “exposed” as an unacceptable provocation. And may even furnish the pretext for a pre-emptive attack by NATO against Russia. Now let those Pentagon/NATO planners duly go back to play in their lavish kindergarten.

I would like to watch out for you as president of our wonderful country. I will remain loyal to you and make my contribution for a positive future of Austria. Please do not be discouraged.

The remaining 885,000 mail-in ballots – more than 10 percent of the 6.4 million Austrians eligible to vote – took some 20 hours to count, and overturned Sunday’s results. Before the election began, Van der Bellen was considered a firm favorite. It was Hofer who unexpectedly won the first round, though, claiming 35 percent of votes compared to 21.3 percent for Van der Bellen.\\xa0 However, Hofer’s failure to secure a majority of votes paved the way for the runoff. A number of Austrian political analysts and pollsters, including the SORA policy research institute, recently predicted the mail-in ballots were likely to favor Van der Bellen, as the majority of these votes are cast by expatriates who tend to prefer open-border and pro-EU policies. Furthermore, as an economics professor and former head of the increasingly popular eco-friendly Green Party, Van der Bellen has strong support in cities. During his election campaign, Van der Bellen spoke of his hopes for a closing of ranks between supporters of all major parties in order to prevent the Freedom Party (FPO) from winning the election, describing himself as a “lesser evil.” Van der Bellen’s campaign was not as controversial as Hofer’s, who had even carried a gun to election rallies, calling it a “natural consequence” of immigration. Hofer and the FPO’s nationalist appeal to put “Austria first,” paired by strong opposition to “forced multiculturalism, globalization and mass immigration” secured the candidate increasing support because of deepening frustration with the ruling parties and how they are dealing with the migrant crisis that has engulfed Europe. “I'm not a dangerous person, of course. But those people […] who don't appreciate our country, who go to war for the Islamic State [IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL] or rape women – I say to those people: ‘This is not your home! You can't stay in Austria!’ Because we differentiate very clearly between those who continue to build up Austria together with us and those who only care about destroying this country. We have to make this differentiation,” Hofer said in a recent election rally. The prospect of Hofer’s victory shocked European political establishments long before the runoffs. Senior European officials like Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, issued warnings that “Europe’s character will be changed” if the FPO wins the post. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called on Austrian people to vote for any alternative to Hofer. Still, this is the first time in Austrian history that no candidate from the traditionally powerful centrist coalition parties (Social Democratic SPO and Conservative OVP) was represented in the runoffs. SPO member and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann had resigned earlier in May, partly because of his party’ debacle in the first round of presidential elections. Political analyst Gerhard Mangott told RT the huge success of the Freedom Party and the fact that none of the ruling parties even got into the runoffs shows that Austrians are deeply dissatisfied with the way the authorities are dealing with existing problems – with mass immigration just one of these.“It was […] a vote against the establishment. People are fed up with the current government that is not able to deal with the economic crisis in the country. It was a socially-motivated protest against the government,” Mangott said. He also noted that despite losing the presidential election, Hofer and his party’s current success is a clear sign the right-wingers will not take no for an answer and will target the position of chancellor next. “[…] despite the fact that they’ve lost today they will use all the support they’ve received now for the forthcoming parliamentary election.” \"]\n",

The first five teams will get a chance to test their capsule prototypes at a Hyperloop Test Track being built next to SpaceX’s headquarters in California. “We’re going to test (the pods) at the highest possible speed on the 1.5 kilometer track, and of course you have to stop before the end. There will be a foam pit at the end so you might recover some pieces of your pod,” Musk also said. The so-called Hyperloop is a project to create a high-speed transportation system involving pressurized capsules riding on air cushions inside a tube, which would be capable of carrying 20 to 30 people at a speed of about 700 mph (1,127 km/h). The initial design documents published in 2013 proposed a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco that could be traversed in less than 35 minutes. The idea came to Musk as he was stuck in traffic in Los Angeles, thinking that there must be some way to avoid such an inconvenience. \"]\n",

At a time when the world was all about Michael Jackson I secretly always dug Prince a little more.

I'm totally shocked this man is dead at 57 when he should have been doing this for decades to come. We've all been robbed by his passing.  The last time I saw him was at the forum a couple years back and it's the best show I've ever seen. He was so next level that I remember thinking that no one could touch his musical abilities at that moment. My friend Al and I got to go to the after party and meet Prince and hang at his place where he played a private party there might have been 100 of us and I stood front and center watching Prince play guitar like he was being fast forwarded.

Lawmakers at the European Parliament voted 369-255 in favor of the resolution, proposals for which will be addressed at a European Council meeting in December. The resolution envisions dedicating two percent of member nations’ GDP to defence as well as establishing EU multinational forces, to allow the bloc to act in any situation in which NATO could be unwilling to. MEPs called on member states to pursue joint purchases of “defence resources,” and to share non-lethal material such as transport vehicles or aircraft. The resolution asked the European Council to lead the creation of “common Union defence policy and to provide additional financial resources ensuring its implementation.” The legislatures also backed investment in defence-related research projects “of at least €90 million ($96mn) during next three years”, which could be followed up by a separate European Defence Research Programme with an annual budget of €500 million ($530mn). Under the approved resolution, Britain could be forced to help fund the project because Article 50 – the clause which must be invoked to trigger an exit from the union – will not have been enacted by the time the project is ratified. Many in Europe believe such a force is required to bolster the union after the British exit. “At a time when public support for the EU is being called into question in some member states, defense and security is an area where the individual and collective benefits of more Europe can be easily demonstrated, especially regarding the likely challenges to EU’s standing as a strategic actor following Brexit,” the EU has said. The initiative would also see the creation of a European defense minister, who would oversee the army’s foundation, and an almost immediate injection of £76 million (US$95 million) for “preparatory action on EU defense research.” If the UK proves incapable of untangling itself from the plan it could be required to shell out up to £420 million per year. MEPs who are both for and against the idea spoke out on Monday ahead of the main debate. Liberal MEP Urmas Paet was reported in the Express newspaper as saying “the state of European security has grown increasingly fragile. The EU, in order to defend itself and increase security, must do more.” UKIP MEP, Brexiteer and former soldier Mike Hookem, meanwhile, said the army could drag the UK into a war against its will. “It could threaten Britain’s military readiness if it were to be dragged along in an EU military by a political establishment trying it’s hardest to ignore the result of the EU referendum and leave the EU,” he warned. He appeared to argue that EU laws which govern some EU militaries would have a diminishing effect on UK forces. “There are clear security reasons why members of the armed forces are subject to different rules from those in civilian life: rules which were compensated for previously by governments who took the welfare of its troops and this country seriously with work and fiscal benefits,” he said. “It is not in the country’s national interests for soldiers, sailors or airmen to be able to lay down arms and ignore the chain of command because of a union decision. “I have been on exercises with Danish troops who stopped working at 1700hrs. Military life does not work like that and war does not fit into a 9-5 schedule,” he warned. Political writer and journalist Dan Glazebrook believes that the resolution is “not really a surprise.” “Since the economic crisis, a crisis ... [in] the US, and [the] Germany crisis since 1970 on[wards], it has always been a matter of time actually,” Glazebrook told RT. “The whole world is deep in global capitalist crisis. The US is unable, and under Donald Trump is unwilling to finance the military umbrella over Europe,” he said, adding that this was only one reason that led to the plan. “On the other hand, the EU is realizing that subordinating itself to the US is increasingly a game of diminishing returns,” the expert noted. He cited the example of Ukraine, believing that France, Germany and other European countries “had no interest in starting a trade war with Russia … but the US maneuvered them into doing it.” “If they [the EU] want to act independently, if they want to stop being used … then they are going to have to strike on their own,” Glazebrook concluded.

Currently 2 lockdowns in place on DAPL construction by white allies standing in solidairty  w/ Standing Rock #noDAPLpic.twitter.com/Qh18fnogT5 The protesters face charges of criminal trespassing, and the two attached to equipment faces charges of hindering law enforcement and disorderly conduct, according to the Sheriff’s spokeswoman, Donnell Preskey, according to AP. The site near Glen Ullin is not part of the temporary work stoppage ordered by the federal judge or the section the federal government asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on last Friday. Hundreds of people from over 200 indigenous nations have gathered in the area to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which claimed in a lawsuit filed against federal regulators that the oil pipeline would harm water supplies and disturb sacred burial and cultural sites. The lawsuit challenges the Army Corps of Engineers’ decision to grant about 200 permits at water crossings for the pipeline. For now, the federal government has issued a temporary halt to construction on Army Corps land around and underneath Lake Oahe, one of six reservoirs on the Missouri River. Three federal agencies also asked Energy Transfer Partners for a “voluntary pause” in work for 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe. “We are dealing with a world that doesn’t understand who we are,” Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told RT. “It is time, it is really time, for the world to understand that there is something deeper than this Western-type of development that continues to take and take out of Mother Earth without giving back.” Goldtooth from the Navajo Nation said there is a “tremendous need for the world to re-evaluate its own understanding of nature, its own understanding of its relationship to Mother Earth.” “Those are some of the things that are part of this whole convergence here is around a system’s change, not climate change, and especially how we work together, interact with each other, nation to nation, as indigenous nations and colonial nations,” said Goldtooth. “It is a new chapter, that is what is happening here, a new convergence for a new chapter and how we communicate, and how we respect each other and how North Dakota as a state of the United States government how it communicates much better policies of consultation what exist now.” The head of Energy Transfer Partners told employees in a memo Tuesday that it was committed to the project despite strong opposition and a federal order to voluntarily halt construction near Stand Rock Sioux tribe reservation in North Dakota. “I am confident that as long as the government ultimately decides the fate of the project based on science and engineering, the Dakota Access Pipeline will become operational…So we will continue to obey the rules and trust the process,” Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, wrote to employees, according to Associated Press. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and the thousands of others who have gathered at the southern North Dakota site won’t budge. “People are still coming down here and are committed to stopping the project,” he told AP. Energy Transfer Partners are developing a $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, that once completed would travel through four states. The 1,172-mile project would carry nearly a half-million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota’s oil fields through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Illinois.  ']\n",

Nevertheless, it was always clear that Clinton's campaign strategy had some serious flaws. Most of us thought this would simply make it a tight race, but that Clinton would undoubtedly pull through. Now, however, the events of the aftermath – on top of the obvious mistakes already made – make the reasons Trump pulled off the shock victory clearer than ever.  Liberals for Clinton spent this election doing three things that were entirely counter-productive and which now they should regret. READ MORE: How Trump won the White House: Key moments of #Election2016 First, they ran a campaign which based itself less on issues and more on the fact that Trump doesn't appear to be a very nice person. Now, while this may be true and even seemed like a logical strategy at times (during p*ssy-grabbing-gate, for example), ultimately it's not how you win over or inspire people. Second, instead of debating and engaging with people, a huge chunk of Hillary supporters decided anyone who didn't agree with them was a racist, sexist, uneducated waste of oxygen. In fact, their own candidate even appeared to back them up in this line of thinking by calling Trump supporters “deplorables.” Instead of sucking it up and realizing that their Trump friends had the right to an opinion – and were not necessarily racist and sexist – these overly sensitive souls ran off to their “safe spaces” where differing opinions couldn't reach them. This led to a lot of unfriending on Facebook, and probably a significant chunk of secret Trump voters who came out only in the privacy of the voting booth. As such, the polls that Clinton relied on to read the country's mood were almost all wrong. The refusal to acknowledge Trump supporters as human beings with their own, perhaps legitimate, reasons for favoring him was a major failure of the Clinton camp. This is much the same thing that happened in the UK with the Brexit vote. Look at the #BasketOfDeplorables in Pensacola Florida last night! What a horrible statement. #CrookedHillarypic.twitter.com/GfevT0KUjd Third, they played the blame game in a way that really backfired “big-league,” as Trump would say. If Trump's support had to be acknowledged, it must be blamed on anyone but Clinton or the status quo of American politics which she was trying to protect. Their favorite strategy in this regard was to blame Russia. This was odd because most Americans probably don't give a flying toss about Russia, but Vladimir Putin became the “secret mastermind” behind Trump's successes, not the fact that millions of ordinary Americans were hurting and feeling left behind and ignored by decades of policies which never seemed to take them into account. Julian Assange and WikiLeaks\\xa0were Putin's puppets, too. And so was Green Party candidate Jill Stein. They were all part of a massive Kremlin plot, you see. That's what you would have believed if you'd listened to some Clinton surrogates and fans in the media. It was real 'Russia ate my homework' level stuff – and it has likely flamed the fury of Clinton's supporters trying to come to terms with how they lost. Not surprisingly, the blame game has continued in the aftermath of Clinton's loss, but now the main culprit is the Electoral College system, which has suddenly become the major focus of Clinton supporters who last week were perfectly happy with it. Last chance? #Clinton supporters petition to force Electoral College to vote for her December 19 https://t.co/U4pa0EtrUJ Only the popular vote matters, they say. Clinton's loss isn't fair, they cry. Millions of them have signed petitions trying to have Clinton elected anyway. Unfortunately for the disappointed, signing petitions isn't how you elect a president – and it is truly fascinating how quickly liberals who love democracy seem to forget all about it when their candidate loses. Ask them if they would be complaining about the Electoral College and its fairness if Clinton had won and they quickly go quiet. There's another parallel here to the Brexit vote and how pro-EU voters tried to annul the majority's choice on the grounds that they were the “stupid masses.” Then there's the protesters; the people who have actually taken to the streets to dispute the outcome of a legitimate election simply because they don't fancy dealing with the result. The rather ironic theme seems to be: Trump is an evil fascist who hates democracy and will destroy America, so we need to violently overthrow him. Now, protesting is fine, it's their right to do so. Many people are legitimately worried about the kind of era Trump will usher in. But there's a kind of hypocrisy to it as well. If you asked these liberal anti-Trump protesters why they weren't out protesting Obama's drone war, or his funding of terrorists in Syria, or Hillary's hand in the destruction of Libya, they'd barely know what you're talking about – which brings us finally to the media and its role in all of this. Liberals weren't bothered by most of these things because the media told them not to be. Bombings under Obama were humanitarian airstrikes. The mainstream media made anti-war liberals fine with war because a nice man with a pretty family was dropping the bombs. Journalists and pundits became so entrenched in their own perspective and bubble that they couldn't even mask their disbelief and anger over the outcome on election night. Literally until moments before the race was called for Trump, anchors and pundits were talking about Clinton's path to 270 delegates when, to anyone facing reality, it had been clear hours before that she probably didn't have one. Trump's victory is beyond comprehension for Clinton supporters and the media because for so long they've failed to live in the real world where there are two sides to every story. There's a lesson there for anyone who wants to take it.

Instead of seeking for a major role in NATO’s buildup against Russia in Eastern Europe and in the Baltics, Berlin should do its utmost to improve relations with Moscow. It was therefore a “serious mistake” that Germany assumed leadership over NATO troops near Russia’s borders “right on the [75th] anniversary of the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941,” Schroeder said at a German Chamber of Commerce event in Austria, as cited by the Salzburger Nachrichten\\xa0newspaper. Moscow calls NATO buildup in E. Europe ‘unjustified’ as largest drills since Cold War kick off https://t.co/4IThutir73 The date of the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union, June 22, is marked in Russia annually to pay tribute to war victims and Red Army soldiers killed or missing in action. Schroeder has also said that “overall, the EU needs Russia and Turkey in terms of security policy,” once again showing discontent with Washington, which sees Moscow’s “assertiveness” as a threat to NATO’s Eastern European members. If the German government wants the sanctions to be prolonged, “it must not be afraid of explaining this to its population,” Schroeder asserted. In 2014, Crimea seceded from Ukraine following a coup in Kiev, and chose to be reunified with Russia after a referendum. Following the events, the EU imposed economic sanctions on Russia, which targeted major energy corporations, state-owned banks and senior officials. Despite growing resistance inside the bloc and repeated calls from European businesses to lift the sanctions, it is expected that they will remain in place for at least another six months. As part of the Eastern European deployment, NATO plans to station four battalions of up to 1,000 troops each in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. The US is likely to command two battalions, with Britain and Germany taking another each. The German contribution would also include setting up command structures as well as providing logistical support and cyber defense. The deployment aside, NATO is training thousands of troops in a number of exercises that take place near Russian borders. Earlier in June, the largest war games in Europe since the Cold War called Anaconda 2016 started in Poland. They involve over 31,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles from 24 countries, and it is for the first time since the Nazi invasion of Poland that German tanks have crossed the country eastwards. The scenario so far included an airdrop of 1,130 parachutists over the northern Polish city of Torun on Tuesday, involving 500 US and 230 British troops, as well as engineers building a bridge to carry 300 vehicles over the Vistula River and a night-time helicopter “assault” of 35 aircraft. Other regional drills, such as BALTOPS and Saber Strike, are taking place in the Baltic simultaneously with Anaconda 2016. Moscow says it will seek an adequate response to increased NATO presence in close proximity to Russian borders, forming two more army divisions in the west and one in the south. Top officials maintain that it is rather NATO’s “practical actions,” not the bloc’s existence as an organization that poses a threat to Russia. ']\n",

They can’t tell us NOT to do TV right now, we shouldn’t pull ourselves out until they actually do.” “It’s clear that Bernie messed up and that we’re on the right side of history,” Miranda wrote in another bullet point, referring to the Nevada convention. “Let\\'s take this offline,” Wasserman Schultz said in response. “I basically agree with you.\" Wasserman Schultz and Miranda brainstormed ideas to attack Sanders’ position on the Israel/Palestine conflict with her communications team in one thread, with Wasserman Schultz saying that \"the Israel stuff is disturbing” in reference to Sanders’ platform committee appointees attempts to include language denouncing the occupation of Palestinian territory in the Democratic platform. The chairwoman says that the idea “HFA,” or Hillary For America, originally proposed the idea of using Israel/Palestine as “an ideal issue to marginalize Sanders on,” suggesting that the DNC were exchanging communications about anti-Sanders strategies with the Clinton campaign. The DNC also appears to have made a secret “agreement” with Kenneth Vogel, an influential report for Politico. An email from late April with the subject line \"per agreement... any thoughts appreciated\" shows that Vogel sent an advanced copy of a story about Hillary Clinton’s fundraising to the DNC even before his editor even saw it. “Vogel gave me his story ahead of time/before it goes to his editors as long as I didn\\'t share it,” DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote to\\xa0 Miranda. “Let me know if you see anything that\\'s missing and I\\'ll push back.” The published version of the story did not appear to have any significant edits from and was not favorable to the Clinton campaign, but the sending of a full, advanced copy to the subject of a story is considered to be a violation of journalistic ethics. A source with familiar with the interaction between Politico and the DNC told RT America that the message was sent to officials to ensure accuracy in the story, and that it would have been difficult to ask for piecemeal clarifications due to its complexity. The “agreement,” in fact, referred to the DNC promising not to pass the story to a more favorable news outlet who might publish before\\xa0 Politco. Another email released in the Friday leak indicates that the DNC was in close contact with news websites on articles related to the Democratic Party.

Taylor responded saying that the article should be changed the event was run by the state party and the disorder “sounds like internal issues amount [sic] Sanders supporters.” “Walter, please connect with Stewart and get him to push back,” Miranda wrote.

Writing off Bernie Wasserman Schultz seemed to have already counted Sanders out of the race in a May 21 email, when there were still nine primaries to go. “This is a silly story,” the chairwoman said. “He isn\\'t going to be president.” In another email, Paustenbach informed her that Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the candidate should continue to the convention, Wasserman Shultz said: “He is an ASS,” referring to Weaver. The chairwoman made her opinion clear about Sanders in an message concerning the candidate alleging that the party hadn’t been fair to him. “Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do,” she said.

            "['31 Jul, 2016 15:22 ', '‘US foreign policy is a marketing strategy for selling weapons’ – Jill Stein', 'op-edge', 'As the two major US political parties have officially selected their nominees for president, Chris Hedges, host of RT’s On Contact program, discussed with the Green Party candidate for president, Dr. Jill Stein, what could be an alternative way forward. According to Dr Stein, in the current presidential race, the American public is “clamoring for something else at unprecedented levels”. “People have rejected not only both of these parties, which are minority parties by actual polling…Their candidates are running at record levels, all time highest for people disliking the Democratic and Republican candidates,” she said. “The American people and the people all over the world are being thrown under the bus by this political system…in which both parties are basically funded by and controlled by predatory banks, by fossil-fuel giants, by war-profiteers, the health insurance industry - the usual suspects who are calling the shots from behind the closed doors,” Stein says. Stein says that since her campaign and the Green Party “are the only candidates and party” that do not take money from corporations and lobbyists, and do not have super PACs, they have “the liberty to address the crises” that the US people are facing. Speaking about the frontrunners, the Green Party candidate noted that if you “look at the track record, the terrible things that Donald Trump says – which are truly reprehensible and horrific – have actually been done by Hillary Clinton”. For example, she said, “on immigrants, xenophobia and hate mongering, we’ve learned that Trump and the Republicans are the party of hate and fear”. But, Stein went on, “the Democrats are the party of deportation, detentions, and night raids”. And the night-raiding is carried out against the women and children “who are feeling the violence that Hillary Clinton herself gave the thumbs up to with this horrific corporate coup in Honduras”. US policies very much promoted by “Clinton herself are generating these refugees, which she then, and the Democrats, are criminalizing when they get here and sending them back,” says Stein. Speaking about security issues - “finger on nuclear button”, as she put it, the Green Party candidate noted that Trump makes “irresponsible statements” and Clinton advocates the enforcing of a no-fly zone over Syria “against a nuclear armed country that is Russia.” Clinton has already been antagonizing Russia by surrounding it with missile bases and soldiers, Stein said. “How would we feel if Russian troops were amassing on the border of Mexico and Canada?” she added.\\xa0 Dr Stein has called Donald Trump “a product” of economic misery, which created vulnerability, fear, and sense of dread on behalf of the American worker and middle class, “to whom adversity is somewhat new”. “They become very vulnerable to demagoguery, to wishful memory about ‘how we can recreate a powerful America of the past’,” she said. But not much is being asked about what caused this misery. In Stein’s opinion, this goes back to Wall Street deregulation “and the economic crash” that resulted in disappearance of millions of jobs, “stole five million homes out from under home owners, and to NAFTA which basically allowed a million jobs and more to be sent overseas and for wages to be pushed downward.” The Wall Street deregulation passed by Bill Clinton was advocated for and celebrated by Hillary Clinton, she said. “So, putting another Clinton in the White House – that’s not a solution; that was the problem, that is only going to fan the flames of right-wing extremism,” Stein said.  The real solution would be economic investments in a form of a Green New Deal like the one that got the US out of the Great Depression and job-creation, the Green Party candidate said. “This is not a kind of pie in the sky that we can fix this. The real solution here is economic investment; it’s job creation; it’s not wish fulfilment about how Donald Trump is going to cut a better deal for us. Donald Trump leaves a lake of bankruptcies and lawsuits behind him from workers who’ve been cheated, and jobs that have been sent overseas. So, Big Daddy is not the Big Daddy that we need,” she said.\\xa0 The Green Party, she insists, can grow the economy in a just and sustainable way. Her campaign suggests cancelling the student debt that affected about 40 million people “like we cancelled the debt for the Wall Street crooks who crashed the economy.” “If we bailed out the crooks, it’s time to bail out their victims through the same tool of quantitative easing that doesn’t cost taxpayers a thing…” Jill Stein said. \\xa0\\xa0 The US spends a trillion dollars a year on its military, says Jill Stein. If that budget is cut it in half, the American economy will have the money it needs at home to provide for free public higher education, insure any health costs that aren’t covered already and work with other countries to address the problem of climate change – which remains one of the crucial problems globally, she believes.\\xa0 “Few people know what we pay for this catastrophic military which shoots first and asks questions later. In fact, what we have is a foreign policy which is essentially a marketing strategy for selling weapons,” she said. “We’ve had these wars for oil - which are opportunities to sell weapons and to come and dear other people’s fossil fuel resources, which is basically what our military is doing.\\xa0Why do we have a thousand bases for a hundred countries around the world?\\xa0 This isn’t something that other countries do.” The reason why the US keeps doing so is to safeguard its energy supplies and their routes of transportation, Stein says. “This can no longer be justified – it’s all obsolete when we have a Green New Deal, which will reach 100 percent wind, water and sun clean renewable energy entirely by 2030. So, we can begin phasing down this network and stop stealing other people’s oil right now,” she said. The US spent six trillion dollars on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq – both of which failed, the presidential candidate said. The US killed a million people in Iraq alone, “not winning the hearts and minds of people in the Middle East to say the least. And what do we have for it? Failed states, mass refuge migrations that are tearing apart Europe as well as the Middle East, and creating worse terrorist threats,” she added.

Russian oil companies pay most of their expenses in domestic currency (a weak ruble) while getting hard currency (a strong US dollar) for their product. The Kremlin has the option to force Russian oil companies to sell more of their dollar revenues and increase taxes. This would solve two problems. Converting dollars to rubles would strengthen the domestic currency and extra taxes would fill the budget holes. Putin wants to ax dollar from Russian trade https://t.co/JqfgHLX2HTpic.twitter.com/rguTcWGtki Other oil producers may not be as fortunate. Despite falling oil prices, Saudi Arabia is refusing to cut crude output in order to defend its market share. Riyadh is hoping to squeeze out its competitors, primarily the US and Russia. But that's a dangerous game as Saudi Arabia is at risk of depleting its financial assets within five years. In a move that some see as Moscow calling Riyadh's bluff, Russia's Finance Ministry announced in December that it is drawing up plans based on the price of oil as low as $30 a barrel until 2022. That scenario would have devastating implications for OPEC, according to Russia's Deputy Finance Minister Maxim Oreshkin. The economies of less affluent OPEC states are struggling with low oil prices. Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela, have been calling for production cuts in order to increase prices. On the other side of the Atlantic, the prospect of Washington lifting its four-decade ban on oil exports seems like another game changer for Russia. However, American crude producers may not be willing to export oil if the price stays low. If a barrel is more expensive to produce than the market price, it is more likely that US oil companies will slow production and stay on the domestic market.

Russian oil majors are opposed to the Finance Ministry's plan to dip in to their war chest. According to Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, stripping oil companies of extra revenue means leaving Russia’s key economic sector without money for development. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov wants oil companies to pay three times more in taxes than they pay currently – 600 billion rubles instead of the current 200 billion. According to Siluanov, without “devaluation extractions” the budget deficit would grow, making the government borrow and withdraw resources from the private sector and raising rates.\\xa0 The more the oil sector gets, the less goes to others, he said. Another possible move for Moscow to fill the budget is to depreciate the ruble against Western currencies. However, ruble depreciation is a direct way to skyrocketing inflation, reducing domestic incomes and consumer demand - one of the biggest problems for the Russian economy in 2015. And the Kremlin’s target for this year is to cut inflation to 6.4 percent from more than 12 percent in 2015. \"]\n",

As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine’s Maidan coup in 2014. Thus, it’s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of “ministry of truth” with only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington’s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook’s primary news feeds. And this is very dangerous. Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact-checkers to sort out ‘fake news’https://t.co/jZmZXrpl06pic.twitter.com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter’s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling. Because it’s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices. That said, nobody is disputing whether “fake news” is a problem. It’s just hard to find agreement on its definition. For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it\\'s often a different story. Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non-mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked by numerous\\xa0credible sources. And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging that Vladimir Putin\\xa0was using “kompromat” to destroy the reputations of his political opponents. For \\'proof\\' they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography. German politicians want €500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrs https://t.co/VSGNiA2M98pic.twitter.com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper\\'s readers were greeted with this soft-soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins: “His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K.G.B. and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride.” And to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes. Yet, sadly for Higgins - and Bukovsky, of course - his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child porn images\\xa0himself, as \"research.\" Then there’s the Guardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth. A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune - without any explanation - suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the same Washington Post. These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source. And we can’t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times. Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of a love child\\xa0and Moscow developing a Star Trek-esque teleportation device.\\xa0 Are all these not examples of “fake news?” But given that they are establishment names in the western press, don’t expect Poynter to subject them to the same treatment as newer alternative outlets.

Journalists clash in fiery RT debate on news sources in #Syria (VIDEO) https://t.co/ibunqPmH1Vpic.twitter.com/qLtwXN45j7 The list of signatories to the International Fact-Checking\\xa0Network also sets alarm bells ringing. For they include some fairly dubious organizations. Take Politifact, for example. This group has been accused of having a left-wing bias and openly favoring Clinton during the US election campaign. As Breitbart observed: “When Trump said Clinton wants “open borders,” PolitiFact deemed his statement “mostly false” — despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013. “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” she said at the time.” ‘Intolerable & dangerous’: #Auschwitz Committee accuses #Facebook of turning blind eye to hate speech https://t.co/GGY63iSnbTpic.twitter.com/YKcwlOujvk There is no doubt that blatantly made up, let alone poorly fact-checked, stories are poisoning political discourse. And Facebook is right to tackle the type of companies who produce twaddle such as “Hillary invented the Aids virus” or “Trump wants to distribute Mein Kampf to school kids\" or whatever nonsense is being pushed today. However, will it also censure “respected” mainstream outlets who allege that Putin has stolen $200 billion for himself or is planting child porn on dissidents? Because unless they are also labelled with the “fake news” badge, this looks more like an exercise in the US liberal establishment trying to gain control of the distribution of news on social media, as they once did with newspapers and broadcasters.

While Tuesday’s airport bombing looks like an IS operation, Brennan said the group may be reluctant to claim responsibility, because it still wants support of individuals inside Turkey. The US still has “a ways to go” in defeating IS, which “still has a lot of momentum,” Brennan argued. “This country has done a great job since 9/11 making the American homeland much more difficult for terrorist organizations abroad to penetrate,” Brennan added, but Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS/ISIL) is pushing its narrative online, and the takeaway from the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando is that individuals who decide to act can do a lot of damage before law enforcement and intelligence agencies can flag them as terrorists. Most terrorist attacks are directed out of the group’s strongholds in Iraq and Syria, and addressing the threat requires collective, combined effort against both “upstream” leadership and “downstream” dissemination of instructions, Brennan said. During the question-and-answer period, the CIA director argued that he did not disagree with the White House when he testified before the Senate two weeks ago that “our efforts have not reduced the group's terrorism capability and global reach,” of IS. “I’m hard pressed to think about where President Obama and I differ on this issue,” Brennan said. Asked about rooting out IS in Syria, the CIA director repeated the administration’s assertion that the government in Damascus was somehow responsible for the terror group’s rise. He acknowledged, however, that Moscow’s actions in Syria were motivated by a desire to defeat terrorists. President Obama and the US State Department have previously accused Russia of not fighting IS, but propping up the “Assad regime.” The US was working on “getting the trajectory of the Syrian conflict on a better course,” Brennan said, adding that it won’t be resolved on the battlefield. “There’s going to be no way forward on the political front without Russian cooperation,” he added. \"]\n",

New Gallup Poll: opposition to Fracking Mounts in the U.S., now 51% -- up from 40% last year https://t.co/Jd1dEshZDhpic.twitter.com/MXfgeN0V3y That is an 11 point increase in opposition since last year. Answering the same question in 2015, 40 percent of Americans were in favor and 40 percent were opposed, while 19 percent had no opinion. The poll was conducted between March 2 and March 6. Noting the six point decrease in Americans who had no opinion of the technology, Gallup noted that that could partially account for the rise in opposition to fracking, as a result of the term becoming “more commonplace in the culture, or as the media has more extensively covered the arguments for and against fracking.” Increased opposition could also come from the low oil prices, greater energy independence, and a turn towards alternative, sustainable energy sources, Gallup noted. “Americans’ turn against fracking comes as the percentage predicting there will be a critical energy shortage in the next five years has fallen to a new low because of lower gas prices. With oil and gas relatively cheap, many Americans may not see the need to fracture the earth through fracking,” said the polling agency. This should worry US shale drillers: Gallup poll shows 51% oppose fracking with just 36% in favor https://t.co/0pJp4zO09y The poll also found that Republicans are not as supportive of fracking in 2016, with only 55 percent in favor compared to 66 percent last year. There was not as much change among the Democrats, with 25 percent in favor this year compared to 26 percent in 2015. Fracking has become a contentious topic in American life. The method has provided great opportunities for the nation’s crude oil producers, with half of US oil production currently acquired through fracking compared to just 2 percent in 2000. US reliance on domestic supply, however, has caused a global tug of war with Saudi Arabia, which has been driving down the price of oil to try and make fracking too expensive in the US. A number of US companies have folded as the oil prices bottomed out. Fracking-caused earthquakes put 7 million Americans at risk – USGShttps://t.co/UeVQ8igD0ypic.twitter.com/XqgqVBVaJ7 Environmentalists blame fracking for earthquakes across sections of the country which are typically tremor-free. Last year there were more than 1,000 earthquakes in central US. This week, the US Geological Survey said 7 million Americans are at risk of experiencing earthquakes caused by fracking in the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. The same survey said the state of Oklahoma had a one in eight chance of experiencing earthquakes surpassing the state of California. There are 4,500 oil and gas wells in Oklahoma, and 3,200 are operational daily. “Induced quakes have become more frequent because there’s more wastewater from oil and gas operations around the country that has to be disposed of,” Mark Peterson, seismic hazard expert at USGS, told National Public Radio. “Companies pump it down into underground well, and sometimes that water raises pressure on underground faults that then slip and cause small quakes.” It is not just the threat earthquakes that has people in opposition to the method but also pollution to groundwater. Earlier this month a federal jury ordered Cabot Oil & Gas to pay more than $4.24 million in damages to two families in Dimock, Pennsylvania, who claimed the company's fracking operations contaminated their groundwater with methane. The verdict comes at the end of a long-running federal case that pitted Dimock homeowners against Cabot, one of the largest gas drillers in Pennsylvania. State regulators blamed faulty gas wells drilled by the company for leaking combustible methane into Dimock's groundwater. The company argued the methane was occurring naturally. ’Gasland’ families win $4.24mn fracking lawsuithttps://t.co/UiGuSMpCKSpic.twitter.com/iWxGhKA87D More than 40 families have sued Cabot since they began fracking to extract natural gas from underground shale formations near Dimock in 2008.

            "['5 Oct, 2016 10:43 ', 'Murder of prominent Jordanian writer Nahed Hattar: Who pulled the trigger?', 'op-edge', 'Nahed’s crime? Sharing a cartoon on Facebook that depicted a depraved extremist issuing orders to a meek God. He didn’t draw the caricature himself – he simply shared it. And he nuanced the post with an important caveat: that this was “ISIS’ God” – not Islam’s. This is the first time in memory that a Jordanian journalist has been murdered for his views, and it has shaken up a country that prides itself on ‘security’ amidst a neighborhood rife with instability and violence. The killer, 49 year-old Riad Abdallah, has a checkered past. Nahed’s family said they have learned Abdallah used to fight in Iraq with Al-Qaeda, but was “rehabilitated” upon his return, eventually gaining employment with two government ministries, the Ministry of Awqaf (Endowment and Islamic Affairs) – an unpaid gig – and the ministry of education, where he received a salary and housing. In addition, this known extremist was a part-time preacher at two mosques in Amman. But Nahed’s brother Majed Hattar says the family’s fight isn’t with the killer, who is a “little thing” in a much larger picture. Instead, says Majed, with focused fury: “The bullets that killed Nahed Hattar were shot on the day the prime minister gave the order to arrest Nahed Hattar.” The family is currently assembling a lawsuit to charge various government officials and other entities/individuals for causing Nahed harm and for contributing to the incitement that led to his death. Among these are the prime minister of Jordan Hani al-Mulki, the interior minister Salameh Hammad, the Amman Governor Khaled Abu Zeid, and the head of general security. But it isn’t just the government they blame. Nahed’s family also holds responsible religious authorities – both Muslim and Christian – who fanned the flames almost immediately after he posted the now infamous cartoon on Facebook. Within hours of the post, Al Sabeel, a Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) publication ran a screenshot on its website, censoring the images and language they viewed to be offensive – but more importantly, blacking out Nahed’s explanation that this was “ISIS’ God,” not Islam’s. The Al Sabeel piece went viral, but readers could not even see the content of the caricature or Nahed’s important caveat. A few hours later, Prime Minister Mulki instructed his interior minister to arrest Nahed – his 16th arrest by authorities since 1979. A government statement accused him of “inciting sectarian strife” and “insulting religion.” This, the family believes, was the action that emboldened Nahed’s critics – the ones who sought violent reprisals. What followed takes a big whack at Jordan’s claims to the rule of law and justice. Nahed was incarcerated for a month, during which time – his family says - he was severely mistreated. His sister Kawkab explains that Nahed was beaten so badly by security services in 1998 that he had to have several operations on his stomach, including the removal of two meters of his intestines. “He took medication for this and remained on a special diet until the end,” she says, but was neglected so badly in prison that he ended up in hospital twice during his month-long term. On both occasions, Nahed was handcuffed and shackled to and from the Al Bashir government hospital. The first time, his situation worsened to the extent that Nahed asked to be returned to his prison cell. When the family appealed for help from Amnesty International and the Red Cross, four doctors were brought in to examine Nahed and agreed that he needed special treatment. But instead, when the doctors left, Kawkab says “they ripped out his IVs, left the needle in his arm, cuffed his hands and feet and placed him in a hospital prison cell. They even put a sign at the base of his bed that read ‘dangerous criminal’.” On the outside, social media exploded with exactly the kind of incitement against Nahed that officials had accused him of fomenting. Possibly emboldened by the government’s swift reaction against him, Jordanians took to Twitter and Facebook, threatening Nahed’s life and even offering bounties for several body parts, including his tongue. They did so using their real accounts, with real identities – yet none of them were arrested for incitement. Upon his release, a trial date was set for two weeks later, on September 25. Nahed and his family requested protection, but were denied this and told they would need to get their own security. And then on the first day of the trial, Nahed was shot dead in front of his sons and brothers and dozens of bystanders and policemen at the Palace of Justice. While various authorities immediately condemned the killing of Nahed Hattar, as the day wore on, Jordanians noted shocking scenes of jubilation on social media. Officials slapped together a gag order, and announced that ten social media users had been identified and referred to authorities for “spreading hate speech.” The usual platitudes about balancing security with freedom of expression\\xa0ensued, but there was silence on one important front.\\xa0 Jordan’s King Abdullah made no statement about, or gesture toward, this unprecedented incident until the fifth day after Nahed’s death - when the monarch finally paid a condolence visit to the journalist’s family in their hometown of Fuhays. Says a member of a prominent Jordanian political family that served the current king’s father: “King Hussein would have been there in 30 minutes.” So, why the long silence from the most important figure of authority in Jordan? The country is in the crosshairs of several of the most contentious political battles in the region’s recent history – and religious extremism has flourished in the vacuum created by Jordan’s inability to articulate a clear, strong direction for itself. “In terms of numbers, Jordan has the highest number of jihadists per capita fighting in Syria today than any other country,”\\xa0writes Osama Al Sharif in an op-ed in the Jordan Times.\\xa0 The former president of the Princess Sumaya University for Technology Dr. Hisham Ghassib, a longtime colleague of Nahed’s, says: “The Jordanian state criticizes these terrorists, this ideology, but at the same time it feeds it.” “Since 1975, the government has worked to Islamicize the academic curriculum in Jordan, when Ishak al-Farhan, a member of the Ikhwan, became minister of education,” Ghassib continues. “Look at the curricula. They insert verses of Koran and hadith in everything, even physics, mathematics - everything. And it is to a large extent Wahhabi in interpretation.” “The Ikhwan played a very negative role throughout the decades in this respect,” he adds. “(Current Al- Qaeda leader Ayman) al-Zawahiri was a member of the Ikhwan in Egypt. (ISIS chief Abu Bakr) al-Baghdadi was a member of the Ikhwan in Iraq. (Founding member of Al-Qaeda) Abdullah Azzam was one of the leaders of the Ikhwan in Jordan – and a faculty member at the University of Jordan!” It seems it can be a slippery slope from the “moderate” Ikhwan – which just last month re-joined the political process by securing 15 seats in the parliamentary elections – to “extreme” Salafism. These two themes – the influence of religion in the academic curriculum and the influence of conservative mosque imams on society – are repeated ad nauseam by Jordanians concerned about the environment that led to Nahed’s death. “We’re not against religion, but this is not the role of religion,” explains former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, now one of a handful of scholars and activists working toward developing more secular, diverse educational instruction. “The current curriculum doesn’t teach tolerance, acceptance of other points of view, it doesn’t teach critical thinking, doesn’t teach kids to question.” “We’re very worried about the textbooks. Changes are being driven by the security issue” Jordan now faces, and “after the murder (of Nahed Hattar), you are going to hear an even louder public opinion,” suggests Muasher. He directs me to two vocal fellow advocates who are meticulously investigating the content of the nation’s schoolbooks – both of whom have been directed to “stay at home” by authorities who are now taking death threats much more seriously. One of them is so worried; she refuses to meet with me. The other, an outspoken 35-year former ministry of education official, Dr. Thougan Obeidat - invited me to his home to discuss these issues. A year ago, Obeidat penned a controversial essay in Jordan’s Al Ghad newspaper called “ISIS in our textbooks.” “If ISIS ruled Jordan, they wouldn’t even need to change our textbooks,” declares Obeidat, who has written over 50 articles detailing the problems with the texts. In 2015, the schoolbooks “were pure ISIS culture,” excluding non-Muslims entirely, quoting from violent and lawless religious sayings, characterizing women in extremely subservient contexts. The efforts of Obeidat and others did result in small breakthroughs in the 2016 schoolbooks: a few pictures now portray women without hijab (in their homes, not outdoors), some now show men without beards. There are occasional mentions of churches – reflecting Jordan’s small religious diversity. There is discussion of “human values” - not “Islamic values” as before. Most lessons are still preceded by a Koranic verse in the new versions, but public outrage over the amendments have resulted in several public book burnings - at least two or three last week in the capital. I ask if the Muslim Brotherhood take a position on this issue. “The Ikhwan are not burning the books, but they are the provokers,” says Obeidat, who has received death threats and has also requested government protection. “The Ikhwan are moving everything in the environment, but they don’t appear as the face of it.” Nevertheless, Queen Rania has stepped forward to endorse the new academic initiatives, incremental though they may be. Muasher calls her recent speech on the subject “brave.” Obeidat is grateful for this royal show of support, but notes “the ministry of education, the Ikhwan got angry at her” for taking this stand. If you think Jordan’s academic curriculum is a minefield, wait till you hear about the country’s mosques.\\xa0 Business Insider characterizes\\xa0the problem thus: “The country has 4,500 preachers for its 6,300 mosques, including many who are not properly trained, creating a vacuum that has enabled extremist lay preachers to step in.”\\xa0 Just like part-time preacher Riad Abdallah, the Salafist gunman who took Nahed’s life. “Jordan’s decision makers don’t seem to understand that we are heading toward an explosion,” says Sunni cleric Dr. Mustafa Abu Rumman – a friend of Nahed’s since 2011 and his fellow activist against Islamic extremism. In mosques today, says the English-speaking preacher, “They pray for the mujahedeen in Iraq, Syria, Chechnya and Afghanistan. They criticize the Jews and Christians and wish their supporters harm.” Part of this is political, he claims. It comes from an “atmosphere” in Jordan since 2006 which turned against the ‘Resistance Axis’ – Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and (then) Hamas - in this region after the Israeli war on Lebanon: “Around one million Iraqi Shiite refugees were kicked out of Jordan then.” He rejects a common Jordanian view that social and economic disparities have caused this new intolerance. These may have played a “very small part” but “even the educated, well-off middle classes have joined Daesh (ISIS).” “A lot of our sons went to Saudi Arabia and studied there. They came back with this extreme education and ideology. In all our Sharia colleges in Jordan, they are from this idea. Now, 90 percent of our mosque imams are Wahhabi thinkers, influenced.”\\xa0 From religion to politics, Saudi Arabia feeling chill of isolation (Op-Edge by @snarwani) https://t.co/DawztS0rrKpic.twitter.com/ptIuUvT4u7 Abu Rumman has also received death threats. A Facebook campaign against him began, he says, after he visited Nahed’s family in the aftermath of the cartoon posting. He is also, at regular intervals, interrogated by the Mukhabarat (internal security service) over his views – which they sometimes think are too politically and religiously inclusive. “I raised the worshippers at my mosque based on moderation, love and humanity,” says Abu Rumman, who defended Nahed’s intentions vigorously when the public outcry over the cartoon first began. “I have, in my mosque, the 10 percent who were not Wahhabized. I used to hold joint Christian-Muslim activities at my mosque – some sponsored by the Awqaf Ministry.” But last month, that same ministry ejected him from his mosque and its accompanying housing. They had terminated his position in June, but he continued to give sermons and teach voluntarily. He tried to appeal the sudden dismissal, but says the minister himself said he “couldn’t do anything for me.” It is ironic that a learned, moderate Sunni cleric was removed from his pulpit, even as Nahed Hattar’s killer was preaching hate at another mosque in the same city. But it is symptomatic of the one-step-forward, two-steps-back approach of the Jordanian political establishment toward the radicalism that has permeated its every institution, whose tentacles reach into every strata of society – unchecked. Hossein Majali, Jordan’s former interior minister says “we are facing a crisis in the Islamic world” where there is “less understanding of the basis of our religion and the old boundaries do not stop us any longer.” “The easiest thing to do,” argues Majali “is to treat the symptom – to go to Deir Azzor and bomb ISIS. The hardest thing to do is to go to the production line. That production line is everywhere – in the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Afghanistan, so many places.” Majali suggests “hard measures” as a solution\\xa0– not just in schools and mosques, but especially in “social media, internet, media in its full spectrum.” He says government steps are in their “infancy. We’ve let it pass for a very long time and we’ve looked the other way.”\\xa0 That’s hard to swallow – or accept – when it was this very country, and this very king, who delivered the “Amman Message”\\xa0in 2004, to rally Islamic consensus around a unified, inclusive and tolerant vision for Islam.\\xa0 Jordan has veered so far from that path in the last dozen years, it is hard to imagine an initiative that has failed more dramatically. And it is difficult to conceive that the impotent institutions that allow extremism into their schools and places of worship - that have allowed thousands to train and march into jihad - could actually formulate a decisive plan to cull this virus. Especially since the infection is everywhere, even inside its decision making bodies. Nahed Hattar was sometimes cantankerous and difficult, single-minded and biting, but he forced Jordanians to confront their ills, with great courage and style. The diversity of his opinions lent his beloved country the color it lacked within its beige, monochromatic institutions – the kind of ideas that can move mountains, if only one has the clarity of vision to see the opportunity. Jordan is paralyzed, however. It has no vision, will or courage any longer. Decision makers tip toe around the edge of their own irrelevance. Nahed will be missed, even by Jordanians who don’t know he is gone, because Jordan is one shade duller. And they will be one step closer to the Salafist madness that has swept the Levant, because one more barrier has fallen against takfirism. Says his brother Majed: “These people live in the dark. They can’t even take the light of a candle – and Nahed was like the sun.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

The Russian President couldn’t have made his position more obvious if he’d turned up with flowers in his hair and released a flock of white doves while humming Beethoven’s Ode To Joy. There are three likely reasons for his sudden reticence. First, a feeling that Russia’s Syria policy has largely succeeded. Also, how domestic economic concerns, facing a possible 2018 re-election campaign, need to be addressed after some years when foreign policy was a priority. And thirdly a willingness to give Donald Trump time to show whether his campaign rhetoric about building a new relationship with Russia is actually implemented when in office. There’s also the issue where some of Trump’s cabinet picks are favorable from Moscow's viewpoint. Notably, the choice for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Thus, it’s reasonable to suggest that Putin would be wary of saying or doing anything which might jeopardize the ExxonMobil chairman’s chances of winning Congressional approval.

Unlike previous years, the world order, neither new or current, received little mention and the star of the show was more interested in cracking jokes than lambasting anyone. Clocking in at around four hours, Putin answered questions from a wide range of journalists. Of course, we had some fawning admirers, a few literally shaking with excitement at being chosen. But, on the other hand, there were also posers from liberal Russian opposition reporters and a Ukrainian was given a chance to grill the president. On top of this, some Western outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal, BBC, and NBC were also handed the microphone. Detractors of the format wail about the lack of follow up questions and a few dismiss the exercise as a ‘stunt.’ Nevertheless, even Putin’s biggest critics would surely admit that regarding mastery of his brief and the ability to authoritatively speak on so many topics, without an autocue, the Russian leader’s performance is remarkable. It’s also very doubtful if any other major world leaders could pull off a similar presentation. From a domestic perspective, and after all the news conference is primarily aimed at Russian voters, Putin had relatively good news on the economy. He forecast how the country’s GDP is only expected to contract by 0.5 percent this year “thanks to growth in the real sector of the economy.” This follows a 2015 shrinkage of 3.7 percent. While the recession has largely been caused by falling energy prices, the Kremlin has made efforts to diversify the economy. “We exported $14 billion of weapons, $7 billion in IT services and we have pockets of expertise. In aviation and defense, we are world leaders.” The president also spoke of an agricultural revival. Under his watch, Russia has flipped from being a net grain importer to becoming the planet’s biggest exporter of the foodstuff. Speaking of oil, Putin maintained how his government expects a $40 a barrel price for the black gold in 2017. However, all experts in the sector project $50 and plus. That would mean an extra $21 billion for state coffers next year, significantly reducing the budget deficit. Although Putin’s current term runs to 2018, The Wall Street Journal wanted to know if we can expect an early election. The president’s quip, “in which country,” masked speculation in the ‘expert community’ about a snap poll. Later, Putin insisted how he mightn’t even seek another term. “Time will tell, I'll decide based on the state of the country and the world, and what we’ve done and what I can do at that stage,” he replied. There was a very deliberate nod to Trump when he said: “Russia is stronger than any potential aggressor in the world today.” In Putin speak, this translates as ‘Moscow no longer sees America as a potential enemy.’ Because he recently admitted and repeated here, that the US is the world’s most powerful military player. However, he sounded a note of caution on nuclear proliferation and a potential new arms race. While the statement “we have overhauled our nuclear missiles, have new nuclear submarines, new airbases, and improved aircraft, but in full compliance with the START treaties” sounds menacing out of context, it is somewhat different in another light. “In 2001 (it was actually 2002), the US pulled out of the ABM (anti-ballistic missile treaty). This was the cornerstone of European security. We said we’d respond.” Hence, Putin appeared to be opening the door for new arms control agreements with Washington. Regarding US internal affairs and the repeated claims of Russian interference in the recent election there, Putin scoffed at the allegations. “They are attempts by the Democrats and the current administration to blame their failures on external factors. The Democrats didn't just lose the presidential election, but the House and the Senate as well. Did I do that as well? They need to learn to lose with dignity,” he jibed. He also reached out to Republican voters and moderate Democrats saying “the vast majority of the US population have the same ideas of threats and challenges and share our traditional values.” On the first meeting with Trump: We will discuss how to put Russia-US relations back on track Two years ago, Ukraine was the main topic here. This year, the tone had also mellowed. He called for the normalization of relations with Kiev: “We have come a long way since the summer of 2014.” Lashing out at the “cold war” visa system in Europe, which isn’t based on GDP but rather on “values,” he praised Brussels’ apparent offer of open access to Ukrainians, which surprised some on social media. “I fully support the EU's decision to allow visa-free travel for Ukrainians,” Putin remarked. Yet, it didn't placate a Ukrainian reporter present who asked: “You do realize that even if one day you leave office, Russians will stay occupiers for Ukrainians?” Putin shot back, “If the Ukrainian army wasn't considered as the occupant in their own country in the Donbass that would change the situation.” Other talking points included when the President insinuated how Ankara may have problems inside its state services, “I'm no longer so skeptical that SU-24 (the Russian jet shot down by Turkey in 2015) wasn't shot by a rogue pilot too.”\\xa0 And when he asked his Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, to find someone from “TV channel RT, which is accused of all sorts of cardinal sins.” He also observed how “what we have between Russia and China is more than just a strategic partnership.” And that first meeting with Trump? “The newly elected president needs time to build his team, it's not expedient to meet unless ready,” Putin cautioned. Nevertheless, their initial encounter will certainly be one of the news events of 2017.

A spokeswoman for the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which asked Cameron in March if he would appear before the end of April, told the Press Association the panel would now press ahead with publication of its report into the war. Prime ministers traditionally refuse to attend Commons Select Committee meetings, leaving them to governmental department heads instead. US President Barack Obama recently claimed the PM had appeared “distracted” during the Libyan war, though the Atlantic magazine reported in March that Obama privately refers to the war as a “sh*t-show” of Cameron’s making. Recent rumors that the UK could intervene in Libya again with a commitment of 1,000 troops have died down after widespread criticism. Libya’s new UN-brokered unity government rejected the idea of accepting UK troops almost immediately upon arrival in the war-ravaged capital of Tripoli in mid-April. The new authority apparently felt it would look like a Western lackey if its power obviously derived from foreign military support. Mattia Toaldo, a Libya specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Times newspaper at the time that officials in the new administration are afraid of being seen as “foreign puppets” and hope “people in Europe will stop talking about this for a few weeks.” Tory MP Crispin Blunt, chairman of the UK Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, has been an outspoken critic of both the original war and calls for further intervention.

The trailblazing aircraft is the brainchild of Shenyang Aircraft Corp, part of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). According to AVIC, the FC-31 has a maximum take-off weight of 28 metric tons, a flight radius of 1,250km, and a top speed of Mach 1.8 (or 1.8 times the speed of sound.) The aircraft can easily carry 8 tons of weapons, holding six missiles in its internal weapons bay, plus another six under its wings. Sergey Kornev, head of Russia’s Air Force Equipment Export Department, earlier told RIA Novosti the J-31 will fly on Russian aircraft engines RD-93. A publicity officer at AVIC, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the flight test to the China Daily. The FC-31 first came under the spotlight in 2012 when the first prototype managed to stay airborne for as long as 11 minutes during a test. The new fighter boasts a number of improvements over the previous one, experts say.\\xa0 “Compared with the first FC-31, there are a lot of improvements on the second prototype. Changes were made to the airframe, wings and vertical tails, which make it leaner, lighter and more maneuverable,” Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing, told the newspaper. Another aircraft expert told the China Daily that the new FC-31 has been equipped with an electro-optical targeting system and helmet-mounted display. According to Fu Qianshao, the next challenge for AVIC is to use the FC-31 to capture market share at home and overseas. “I believe the aircraft will have bright prospects in the market. Based on my experience and knowledge, I presume its price will be around $70 million, about half that of the United States’ Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,” Fu said. “Moreover, the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighter jets are priced at about $100 million. All of these mean you can spend a lot less money to get an advanced, fifth-generation stealth combat plane,” he added. The deputy general manager of AVIC, Li Yuhai, previously told the newspaper that the company wants the FC-31 to help “put an end to some nations’ monopolies on the fifth-generation fighter jet” and this plane “is able to compete with any other aircraft of its kind.” The only fifth-generation fighter jet currently available on the market is the US Lockheed Martin\\xa0F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine combat aircraft designed to perform ground attack and air defense missions.

It makes use of the technical expertise of the Russian arms producer Almaz-Antey. The leader of the group and author of the report is Yury Kotenok, editor-in-chief of the news website Segodnia.ru. The biggest challenge for them is to help shed light on the absolute truth behind the tragedy. Their primary objective is to cut short the continuous spread of disinformation regarding the MH17 international investigation.\\xa0 According to the authors of the Russian report, published on Tuesday, Bellingcat is “ready to design any version whatsoever meant to accuse Russia.\" “That’s an information war,” Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the chief designer of Almaz-Antey, said in an interview with the\\xa0Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “[Bellingcat’s] version [of the tragedy] is evidence-free. They do not build a version based on facts, but trim the facts to fit their version. Just to give an example, the Dutch, at the suggestion of Bellingcat, claim that the missile flew toward the plane. This has been refuted by all our data, both mathematical and experimental,” he noted on Friday. The first discrepancy, noted by the Russian activists that Bellingcat\\xa0was trying to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a BUK missile system belonging to the Russian army.\\xa0 As “proof” Bellingcat referred to a Paris Match photo in July 2014 in Ukraine allegedly showing a BUK missile system being transported near Donetsk. The British outlet compared it with a picture of a BUK on the way inside Russia in Belgorod Region, alleging they are one and the same. However, in their report, Russian activists note a\\xa0key difference\\xa0between the two. The BUK pictured in Russia contains a \"step\"\\xa0on the left side of the system. It has been introduced only after 1984 to ease the crew’s embarking to the vehicle.\\xa0The picture posted by Paris Match and cited by Bellingcat does not have that feature,the activists note. “This means only one thing – the photographs presented different modifications of the ‘BUK’ systems, so, as sad as it might be for Bellingcat, there is no way it can be one and the same vehicle,”\\xa0the report states. In the report Russian activists have countered Bellingcat’s claims that there have been no Ukrainian BUK missile systems in the conflict-zone in the country’s East. They provided various screen shots of Ukrainian media reports, picturing BUK missile systems of the Ukrainian army in the conflict area. One of the screenshots contains part of the program called “Hour CH” by the Ukrainian First National TV channel. The respective program is dated July 16, just a day before the MH17 crash. “The photo shows a self-propelled fire installation \"Buk\" [missile system] and radar 19ZH6 (35D6). This radar station in the Ukrainian army is used as an additional means of controlling the air space and targeting systems for air defense fire units, armed with ‘Buk’ [missile system]”, the activists’ investigation finds. Ukraine\\xa0“does possess BUK missile systems of type BUK M1”\\xa0and Kiev has in fact confirmed the modernization of some of it, adviser to the head designer of the Russian Almaz Antey arms producer, which also manufactures BUK systems, Mikhail Malyshevsky, told RT. Last Wednesday, Russian media obtained a statement by Almaz-Antey, in which the company accused Western media, including Bellingcat, of trying to manipulate public opinion and confusing facts to discredit its own investigation into the issue. Russian activists have also raised questions over Bellingcat’s allegation that the location from where the plane has been shot down by BUK was under rebel control. Bellingcat backs up its claims by showing maps of the conflict region provided by the Ukrainian military as well as services like LiveUAmap и kot-ivanov. But in fact Bellingcat itself admits that the official maps “did not reflect the full picture” of the fighting, according to Russian activists’ report. LiveUAmap has also a problem of being rather not accurate, showing some of the fighting “deep inside Russian territory,” the document adds. Russian bloggers accused Bellingcat of simply “interpreting facts” to suit their theory. “Even an approximate study of the evidences which are imposed by Bellingcat as irrefutable, allow us to make a conclusion about their\\xa0untenability,”\\xa0the report says.\\xa0 Speaking to RT, the former deputy chief of the Russian Air Defense forces, Aleksandr Tazehulalov, said the Malaysian Boeing might have been shot down unintentionally. “Many are inclined to believe that given the severe condition of the Ukrainian army at that time, the preparation of the crews of anti-missile systems was not enough for their effective use. I cannot confirm this theory … but every crew can make a mistake, there is this notorious human factor. I do not exclude it,” he said. Ukraine has been already involved in a civilian passenger jet being brought down by a missile over its territory. On October 4, 2001 a Russian TU 154 liner was shot down by a Ukrainian S-200 missile during drills in the Black Sea, killing all 78 people onboard. Back then Kiev officially recognized the responsibility and issued an apology. On September 28, the Dutch-led Joint Investigative committee will release its findings on the criminal part of the investigation, which is expected to name the exact responsible side for the crash. Malaysian Boeing MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed over war-ravaged East Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people onboard. ']\n",

Thierry Mariani, a member of the center-right Republicans party, who initiated the parliamentary debate, said anti-Russian sanctions should be lifted because they only cause harm. \"We are demanding that the sanctions be lifted because they are totally ineffective and they are dangerous for our economy,\" he told the Assembly. \"I have seen our minister of agriculture standing in front of our farmers and say \\'We have to lift the sanctions.\\' I\\'ve seen the minister of finance reiterate the same thing.

A report\\xa0carried out by UK nonprofit group CAGE says this stealth government program has been in operation since 2011. The study, which was published Tuesday, warns the secret nature of the project and the misinformation it spreads are a poor reflection on a government that claims to uphold transparency. CAGE suggests public relations firm Breakthrough Media is tasked with spinning these counter-narratives and is likely protected under Britain’s Official Secrets Act (OSA). The advocacy group says the use of this legislation to cloak a government propaganda project in secrecy is a grievous abuse of government power. **Exclusive**CAGE reveals groups involved in covert Government propaganda programmehttps://t.co/KBr2e6MaqRpic.twitter.com/LSAIVi3i2i CAGE insists it would never disclose data that could undercut Britain’s national security. However, it says the Home Office’s clandestine propaganda project – run by the Research, Information and Communications Unit (RICU) – abandons democratic debate and due process in favor of state secrecy. CAGE argues the root causes of “politically motivated violence and radicalization” cannot be uncovered by a securitized government response and the Home Office must embark on broader ideological terrain in order to tackle these issues. Ben Hayes, who co-authored CAGE’s report, said the government’s secret propaganda project is damaging to society. “We should be under no illusion as to what is going on here. When the government starts using community groups and NGOs to disseminate government propaganda to hoodwink the public into believing they are authentic ‘grassroots’ campaigns, it damages everyone in civil society,” he said. “Democracy requires clear lines between the security state and the police on the one hand, and civil society, public and social services on the other.” UK government \\'running covert counter-extremism propaganda campaign\\' https://t.co/qymlmHAzrUpic.twitter.com/s0ZKytI716 Hayes called for honesty with respect to state-sponsored propaganda projects. “Having railed against ‘sock-puppet’ NGOs and introduced a ban on charities in receipt of public money lobbying government, it is time for an honest conversation about the impact, legitimacy and effectiveness of the government’s own secret propaganda programs,” he said. CAGE Research Director Asim Qureshi, who also co-authored the report, said RICU is using so-called grassroots organizations as convenient government mouthpieces. “There is also evidence to suggest that the government is using the Official Secrets Act to hide its relationship with the role of Breakthrough Media, the PR company driving the propaganda. This suggests an abuse of power and a contempt for open society,” he said. “The findings of this report should be a cause of concern to the British public. It confirms the hidden hand of those who wish to manufacture consent for the expansion of the security state.” RT asked the Home Office whether it could confirm or deny the existence of the RICU propaganda project referenced throughout the report.\\xa0 A spokesperson for the government body defended RICU, praising the support the group has given to government actors\\xa0“working on the frontline” to combat\\xa0the “warped ideologies” of extremism and terrorism. \"This work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard to reach audiences and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare,” the spokesperson said. “We respect the bravery of individuals and organizations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support, empower and protect them.” Extremely worrying that covert government elements infiltrating uni campuses https://t.co/guhbnsnG6N#Prevent#RICUhttps://t.co/u5rAmIQnMD The Home Office spokesperson said the government body is as transparent as it can be about RICU’s operating model, but failed to make any mention of whether the organization is covered by the Official Secrets Act (OFA). \"Our guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do,” the spokesperson said. “At the same time we are as open as possible about RICU’s operating model, and have referenced the role of RICU in a number of publications and in Parliament.” ']\n",

The US vessels, that according to the Pentagon were on their way from Kuwait to the US naval base in Bahrain, experienced mechanical problems and drifted into Iranian waters where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) detained everyone onboard.  Footage of nine men and one woman in Iranian custody made world headlines, forcing US Secretary of State John Kerry to use his diplomatic channels to secure the release of US servicemen just hours later. The incident, however, increased the confrontation level between the two navies in the region. On Sunday, adding fuel to the fire, Commander of the IRGC, Second Naval Zone General Ali Razmjou told reporters that “thousands” of valuable documents were seized from the US sailors at the time of their brief detention. “We seized thousands of pages of valuable intelligence from the US marines during their detention,” said General Razmjou in the Bushehr province on Sunday, FARS reports.\\xa0 The General did not disclose the type of information or content of the intercepted files, but Razmjou’s claim seems to support the US Navy report in June that found that some US seamen captured by the Iranians might have shared sensitive information with their captors that included information on the capabilities of their vessels. “It is clear that some, if not all, crew members provided at least some information to interrogators beyond name, rank, service number and date of birth,” the report\\xa0said.\\xa0 While interactions between Iranian and US ships are common, American officials have raised growing alarm recently about the risk of an escalation at sea between the two states.

In relevant remarks made by Tangsiri in July, the general said that US warships and their allies have been warned to stay out Iran’s territorial waters. “We have a strong presence in the quintuple regions of the South and our independent bases in the Sea of Oman, in such a way that foreign vessels never dare to approach regions 12 miles away from our territorial waters and if they do, they will be treated like what we did to the Americans (on January 12),” Tangsiri said in July.

According to the report, Vladimir Putin and his administration ‘probably’ had motive to murder Litvinenko. British judge Robert Owen, who was leading the inquiry, claimed the poisoning of Litvinenko by former KGB members Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun was a part of the operation of the Federal Security Service (FSB.) Litvinenko died in a London hospital from polonium poisoning in 2006. “This man was killed, was murdered in London almost 10 years ago. This latest report was set up in July 2014 – interestingly, just a couple of weeks after the MH17 disaster. So it was set up in this particular climate, this anti-Russia climate, and it has gone on now for 18 months. And what have they come up with - they’ve come up with a verdict that ‘probably’ this was the work of the Kremlin. “Probably” - is not evidence,” Journalist and broadcaster Neil Clark told RT. “What is lacking – is any hard evidence, this is just conjecture; this is just a theory put forward; one of the theories is that the Kremlin was behind this. But there are other theories too to explain why this man may have been murdered,” he said. “We’ve got to look at the context of this. The fact was this man died in 2006, and we’ve got an inquiry set up in 2014 in the very month when the West was taking very anti-Russian line.” “…If to look at the bigger picture, in 2006 relations between Britain and Russia were improving. So what logic would there have been in the Kremlin ordering this murder in a very public place in London? It doesn’t really make sense, does it? If you think about it from the Russian point of view, this man is a minor figure; he wasn’t as if he was going to stand for president and pose a real threat to Putin. The risk would have been very high and that is what makes me skeptical of the fact that the Kremlin was behind this, and there are other theories to explain this man’s murder,” Clark added. The UK report on the causes of Litvinenko’s death doesn’t have any supportive evidence, and is partly based on statements fabricated by figures like Berezovsky, said William Dunkerley, author of “The Phony Murder.” RT:\\xa0Is the public inquiry really that public? And how different is it from a regular trial? William Dunkerley: First of all it is not a trail at all, this isn’t a judicial procedure, it is a public inquiry. The term ‘public inquiry’ is actually a misnomer, because the rules in the UK allow a public inquiry to be conducted behind closed doors. RT:\\xa0The coroner's inquest into Litvinenko's death was suspended in July 2014 to start a public inquiry shortly after. What can you say about this timing? WD: The timing is interesting, the coroner’s inquest sort of came to an end when the Home Secretary told the coroner to stop conducting an illicit criminal investigation. The coroner is supposed to concentrate on judging the cause of death. Sir Robert [Owen] was not doing that, he wasn’t doing his job. The Home Secretary finally reined him in, told them to concentrate on his statutory duties and asked him to not go off on a witch-hunt for Russian culpability in the case. Then, things changed when Prime Minister [David] Cameron got involved. He put the whole issue back on the table, and turned [Sir Robert] Owen, now chairman of the public inquiry, loose on his search for Russian state culpability. And this coincidently happened on the day that the EU announced additional sanctions against Russia, in a sort of part of the sanctions frenzy that the public inquiry was opened. RT:\\xa0It's been almost a decade since he died, why is the UK launching an investigation now? WD: The story was really confounded by misleading information right from the beginning. One of Putin’s political adversaries Boris Berezovsky, who was a fugitive oligarch hanging out or hiding out in London, made a lot of fabricated statements about the Litvinenko case, that incriminated the Russian state and in particular President Putin. RT:\\xa0Isn’t the fact that that the inquiry was held behind the closed doors make the investigation more complicated? WD: Yes, it is a complication in the investigation that the public inquiry was able to hold hearings behind closed doors. Most of the media reports gave the impression that the public inquiries going to add transparency to the case, but actually the opposite was true. RT:\\xa0Are we seeing the increase of strain in UK-Russia relations? WD: Well, the UK- Russia relations have sort of been up and down throughout the course of this whole thing. At one point the Berezovsky people, Mrs. Litvinenko and others were critical of the UK for not coming to a conclusion about this that would agree with their version of the case. They said that the UK was avoiding doing that, because it didn’t want to offend Russia, in order to preserve relations between the two countries. Now some people theorize that since the UK- Russia relationship is so bad that it doesn’t matter if there is offence given by the report from the public inquiry… …. People are conditioned to believe in the story that has been going on in the news. It is not based on facts and there have not been supportive evidence, but people have been exposed to this story for a long, long time now. The truth that I’ve found in my research is counterintuitive to people who have been following all of the Western news reports. Martin McCauley, former senior lecturer at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London on latest Litvinenko inquiry: “ All they can do, as they said, “we have a prima facie case which proves that Lugovoy and Kovtun were acting as part of the FSB,” which goes right up to Nikolai Patrushev. But prima facie only means on the face of it. Therefore, the case is not proven. In other words it is a probability, and in an English court it wouldn’t stand up, because you couldn’t convict Lugovoy and Kovtun on the evidence, which has been presented in the report… They didn’t cross-examine or interview Lugovoy or Kovtun…” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"]\n",

Detroit-based journalist Abayomi Azikiwe, an editor at Pan-African News Wire, told RT that a lack of cooperation between the US government and that of President Bashar Assad, whose exit Washington considers “a prerequisite” for peace, may be the main reason American airstrikes are claiming civilian lives en masse.\\xa0 “As long as they continue to not work with the Syrian government we are going to continue to see more of these attacks resulting in civilian casualties,” Azikiwe said, pointing out that Syria “never invited the United States to bomb any of its territory.” Azikiwe noted that, while Washington admits it inflicts casualties and pledges to look into cases of civilian deaths, the US military is reluctant to prosecute its own officers and commanders, who bear responsibility for ordering strikes.

The experiments in revolutions are being made in many nations, even in their natural partners such as the countries of the European Union,” Sergey Naryshkin wrote in the article published on Friday in the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “It seems that the transatlantic plans to achieve absolute domination have transformed into an unhealthy maniacal idea,” he noted. READ MORE: PACE monitors not expected at State Duma elections – top Russian MP Naryshkin also wrote that in order to achieve this domination, the United States was skillfully using modern information technology in the propaganda field without any respect towards the sovereignty of independent nations or the principle of non-interference into their internal affairs. “There are no morals or respect for international law in this situation. We cannot describe it as democracy,” he wrote. The speaker went on to state the necessity of breaking the artificial connection between the internal politics of European nations and the processes developing in the international politics. “While accepting the evident fact of ongoing globalization, sovereign nations must seek some constants in their economic and political systems that would guarantee their future from the influence of destructive mechanisms launched from the outside,” Naryshkin stated. He then gave an example of such mechanism saying that the so-called “transatlantic forces” were aggressively imposing their will on European organizations and this resulted in the situation in which European groups distance from their original goals, lose their sovereignty and get staffed by people who are dependent from the “transatlantic forces.”“The most vivid example of such organization is the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Only a key reform of this structure can put it back on the way of normal development and prevent it from becoming a completely marginal site,” Naryshkin wrote, noting also that the full restoration of the Russian delegation’s rights in PACE could be the first indicator of improvement. The Duma chief stated that Russia is inclined towards constructive dialogue with its European partners and the United States, but only on condition that this will be a dialogue of equals. He also emphasized that Russia was against the movements promoting disintegration in Europe as such process carried a lot of regional risks. “We are interested in greater stability of our partners, both as national states and as unions of such states.” Russia’s relations with PACE soured in April 2014 after the assembly approved an anti-Russian resolution on the political crisis in Ukraine. PACE also deprived the Russian delegation of the right to vote and banned it from participating in the group’s ruling bodies and monitoring missions. Russian lawmakers responded with a resolution stating that nations that have repeatedly violated international law and caused thousands of casualties have no moral right to judge Russia or impose sanctions on it. After the scandal, Russian delegation members left PACE because they considered it impossible to resume discussions while sanctions were still in force.

HRW also oversees an international treaty banning cluster munitions. \"Human Rights Watch viewed photographs taken on January 6 in Sanaa that showed unmistakable remnants of cluster munitions, including unexploded submunitions,\" HRW added.

The human rights advocacy group identified the munitions \"as US-made BLU-63 antipersonnel/anti-material submunitions and components of a CBU-58 cluster bomb.\" It added that parts of the bomb remnants had markings indicating that it was manufactured in the US in 1978. According to US export records obtained by HRW, Washington transferred 1,000 such bombs to Saudi Arabia sometime between 1970 and 1995. \"The US is a party to the armed conflict in Yemen, playing a direct role in coordinating military operations, and as such, is obligated to investigate alleged violations of the laws of war in which its forces took part,\" HRW said in its report, adding that an independent, international inquiry into the alleged violations should be set up by the UN Human Rights Council. \"It may have been 20 years since the US last provided cluster munitions to the Saudis, but they are being used to kill civilians now,\" Goose said, adding that if the US fails to prevent any further use of such munitions by the coalition, it risks \"becoming complicit in their use.\" Nearly 2,800 civilians have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, the UN said earlier this week.

Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process. Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years. It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next. A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more. For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame. This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy-eyed patriot boasts. In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous. In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought. At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was “Lock her up! Lock her up!” with all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman’s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house. Trump promises to “Make America Great Again,” a sufficiently open-ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean. Given the billionaire’s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president. But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and is less than enthusiastic about NATO. This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm. Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin. She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, the gloating over the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America’s way be described as progressive. Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have some\\xa0interesting friends and supporters - Wall Street and George Soros prime among them – who aren’t exactly struggling to get by. Then, too, the sympathy she’s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill’s notorious crime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities. This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end. It is a two-term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"Speaking during an exclusive interview with the Times of Israel, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum accused Netanyahu of being personally involved in a bureaucratic process which forced the company to fire its Palestinian employees. According to Birnbaum, it all began when SodaStream decided it needed more space, and opted to close its West Bank factory. The move did, however, follow a boycott campaign\\xa0against the company, in which critics accused it of making money on land “stolen” by Israel.  Though Birnbaum insists the move was made voluntarily, he says the Israeli government is arguing that SodaStream was forced to move due to the pressure from the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as fire the 500 Palestinians working there. But the company insists that despite claims from the Netanyahu government, it wanted to retain 350 of its 500 Palestinian employees to work at its new plant in the Negev. However, according to Birnbaum keeping such a high number of employees was impossible because the company was initially only granted permits for 120 of the Palestinian workers – a number which new conditions later reduced to 74. Since February, those remaining 74 employees have been barred from Israel, their permits retroactively canceled. “Apparently our 74 Palestinians represent a threat to [Netanyahu's] agenda,” Birnbaum said. The CEO says Netanyahu – who he refers to as the “prime minister of conflict” – is responsible for the outcome, adding that his office “intervened to stop the employment of our Palestinians so that Bibi [Netanyahu] can then point a finger at the BDS.” Birnbaum did not mince his words when speaking about the prime minister, accusing him of “systematically spreading hate within Israel between Jews and Arabs and between Orthodox and secular...” “It pains me to say that I believe this administration is nurturing the conflict in all its evil manifestations. They nurture the hate and the boycott and they nurture separatism,” he said. Unsurprisingly, the story coming from Netanyahu's office is starkly different. An official who asked to remain anonymous told the Times of Israel that Birnbaum had relocated his factory because of pressure from the BDS movement. He then noted that once SodaStream was out of the West Bank and inside Israel, it was required to comply with Israeli labor laws – meaning priority had to be given to Israeli workers. “SodaStream went from no quotas at Mishor Adumim, moved inside the Green Line, and was required to follow Israeli labor laws,” the official said. “So it had to lose its Palestinian workers.” The official went on to accuse Birnbaum of being ungrateful towards Netanyahu, as the PM had assisted Birnbaum with a grace period during the transition, arranging for two extensions for Palestinian workers. “The prime minister wanted to help make the transition more smooth. The lack of gratitude is appalling,” the official said. “The PM could have said, ‘We’re not helping him at all.’ Maybe we shouldn’t have helped him. To say it’s personal animus is despicable.” Meanwhile, Birnbaum says that Netanyahu would benefit from taking a leaf out of SodaStream's book, choosing to boost the number of Palestinians working in Israel rather than depriving them of opportunities. He stated that the biggest terrorist threat from Palestinians stems from those working in Israel without permission, stressing that such permits could “buy security.” \"],\n",

              "  ' Current EU rules allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content for three reasons: to comply with a member state’s laws, to manage levels of traffic across a network, or for security. The net neutrality rules are intended to prevent broadband operators from favoring specific sources of content such as commercial partners. Blocking porn falls into a gray area, as there is no clear legal framework in UK legislation. However, a revision to the guidelines issued by EU body Berec says blocked content, whether it is porn or ads, should be implemented by a customer on their device, rather than by the network. Frode Sorensen, co-chair of the Berec working group on net neutrality, refused to comment to the Guardian on specific cases or countries, but said the updated guidance made it clear there was no legal basis for using customer choice to justify blocking any content. ISPs Sky, BT and TalkTalk, and mobile operator O2 block access to adult sites following pressure from the government. Mobile operator Three recently ran an ad-blocking trial that required users to opt in. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson told the newspaper the rules still allowed for internet filters. “Family-friendly filters are permitted under the EU net neutrality regulation. The regulations give end-users the right to access information and content of their choice, and enabling/disabling filters exercises this choice.” A spokesperson for BT told the newspaper: “BT offers filtering at both network and device level dependent on the customer’s preferences. “The Berec guidelines are not binding and it’s for Ofcom to consider in its application and enforcement of EU regulations.” It a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom will monitor compliance with the new rules, and look into any complaints received. We will consider any potential breaches as they arise in accordance with our interpretation of the regulation, and drawing upon the Berec guidelines to inform our approach.” '],\n",

              "  'Belgian investigators revealed at least five of the suspects behind the terror attacks on Paris and Brussels were receiving welfare benefits prior to the atrocities. The Wall Street Journal was one of the first media outlets that reported\\xa0on the story.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were receiving welfare benefits?\\xa0 Gerolf Annemans: People must know that Belgium is one of the most Islamised countries of Western Europe. My party especially concentrates on Jihadi fighters coming back from Syria and what they are still receiving after they’ve gone to Syria. Some of them received health care; we repaired their legs, etc. We discovered also that most of these Syrian fighters get allowances after proving that they are not able to get work. So this is a general phenomenon. Now we are very glad, because the Belgium press put this aside, never focused on it and never mentioned it. And we are very glad that The Wall Street Journal does this now and that we are joined now by the international press, because in Belgium the battle is very severe. The media and the regime are doing this because of what we call the Islamosocialism. All governments in Belgium are either left-wing or central-left wing, or at least are doing what they are doing now and what has been discovered now.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system. What should be done to prevent them from receiving welfare payments?\\xa0 GA: First of all, we have to choose other leaders, elect other leaders; leaders that have steel teeth, and can bite and can fight against Islamization of our society, and for instance blocking the social security. It is an enormous tragedy that we are in this paradox that the Belgium taxpayers paid for this Islamic attacks. We need other leaders, we need other leadership, we need to rethink our western democracies.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Do you think there could be more incidents like this?\\xa0 GA: Well, we have the tragedy of the asylum seekers, the millions that come now and that are all on our social security, because only a tiny minority gets work and helps our economy, or deals with our economy. So most of them end up in our social security system, which is, by the way, the reason why they come to Europe. They don’t stop where it is safe, or where there are no bullets shot anymore. They stop where there is social security. That is why they come to Germany, to Belgium, to Holland, and not to the other countries that they travel leaving Syria. This is a serious mistake to think that we have to change the people of Europe, that we have to exchange them with a new Islamic and mostly Muslim people. This is a failure, a mistake, politically, culturally, in every sense of the word.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Many of the attacks were carried out not by refugees, but by the people who were born or raised in the EU. How do you propose to deal with those kind of people?\\xa0 GA: These people, the people that are here, and are peaceful, and are not radicalizing, or are not promoting Muslim society on Western Europe soil, these people should get the message from our politicians, from our political regimes that they should adapt to our culture of our society. And for the rest we should close the borders that the EU opened widely. We must not let [Angela] Merkel decide our future. People and countries like ours should decide upon that themselves. The Merkel, the [Jean-Claude] Juncker, and the EU way of dealing with these problems is not the way we want it. The people should stand up and vote for leaders in their countries that promise to stop all these.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were getting welfare benefits?\\xa0 Jean Bricmont: I think that is a very bad argument. Of course, if the people knew that they were plotting terrorist attack then it was not a matter of cutting welfare, but putting them away in jail, or under surveillance, or something. The argument against welfare, which is used here, is very bad. It suggests that we should cut welfare, but to whom? To all the Muslim, to all the suspects, to everybody? The present government is already cutting welfare, and welfare has been cut and cut over the years. I think if anything it will probably increase the danger, because it would put more people in a precarious situation, which may lead them to violent action. I don’t think welfare is the problem at all. In fact fiscal fraud is much, much bigger than the welfare spending. So if welfare could prevent the terrorist attack it would be a very small amount of money. You might find it shocking that people on welfare kill other people, but what is shocking is not that they get welfare, but that they kill other people. If they had a job and were not receiving welfare, I would find it just as terrible and shocking.\\xa0\\xa0 It seems to me that The Wall Street Journal, in line with its neoliberal agenda, is trying to use this argument against welfare, which I think is a very bad argument. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is psychologically shocking, but stop and think about it. Stop welfare to whom?\\xa0 If we know that they are terrorists than it is not a matter of welfare, it is a matter of putting them under police control – so a very different business.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system.\\xa0 You would prefer then to ignore that fact, wouldn’t you?\\xa0 JB: Well, the question is: what did the police know? Obviously we should fight the Islamic State. I myself would be in favor of joining Russia in Syria and fighting them, other than doing what\\xa0 we do, which is inefficient bombing. That is a problem on the ground, it is not a problem of Belgian citizens, or even migrants in European countries…\\xa0 RT: How do you assess the level of security in the EU right now in the wake of a spate of horrific attacks, many of which were carried out by refugees?\\xa0 JB: It is pretty bad, but the point is that they are not refugees. Many of these people were citizens of the European countries. They grew up here. I don’t know every individual case, but many of the terrorists grew up here. They got very upset with… the trouble we created in the Middle East and the instability we created there.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Although the votes are still being counted in some states, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote with nearly 59.8 million votes, compared to Trump’s almost 59.6 million votes \\xa0– a lead of about 0.2 percentage points or more than 200,000 votes. Winning the popular vote is a bitter consolation prize for Clinton, as overall victory is based on the 538 members of the Electoral College, each of whom represent a state or the District of Columbia based on population. The number of electoral voters a state gets is equal to its representation in Congress, with a minimum of three (Delaware, DC, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) and a maximum of 55 (California). The winning candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. With Michigan (16) and New Hampshire (4) still outstanding, Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton only 218. Trump is set to become the second president in 16 years to win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote; George W. Bush was the first in the controversial 2000 election. However, it happened twice in 12 years in the 1800s: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Hayes suffered the biggest loss in the popular vote, losing by 3 percentage points to Southern Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Trump comes in second at 1.2 points. Both Bush and Harrison lost by less than a point to Vice President Al Gore and incumbent President Grover Cleveland respectively, according to Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidents. There is one other time that a president entered the White House without winning the popular vote, but that was in 1824, due to a four-way race that did not produce a winner in the Electoral College, forcing the House of Representatives to decide, in accordance with the 12th Amendment. The House elected John Quincy Adams as president. At that point in time, candidates did not run as a combined presidential and vice presidential ticket, and John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency outright. The situation that Trump finds himself in is thus relatively rare, but shifting demographics in the country mean that it could happen more often in the future, according to Vox. The US is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2055, there will not be a single racial or ethnic majority, the Pew Research Center found ahead of the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meeting. Most of those population gains by minorities are occurring in solidly Democratic and solidly Republican states, which means that they did nothing to shift the electoral map. While Trump made headway into all racial and ethnic groups compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, it was still whites who handed him his victory, with 58 percent voting for him, compared to 37 percent for Clinton. Whites made up 70 percent of voters on Tuesday. Trump gained 7 percentage points among black voters, 8 points among Hispanic and Latinos, 11 percent among Asians and 1 percent among other ethnic groups, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polling. However, that doesn’t mean he did well among those groups. The vast majority of black voters (88 percent) chose Clinton, as did 65 percent each of Hispanic/Latino and Asian voters, while 56 percent of people belonging to other ethnic groups voted for Clinton. Millennials ‒ in this case defined as those born after 1980 ‒ have likely replaced the baby boomers as the largest generation. Trump again made headway with this group, gaining 5 points over Romney, but lost the group overall. More than half (55 percent) voted for Clinton, while only 37 percent opted for Trump. It was voters age 45 and older ‒ the baby boomers and Generation X ‒ who gave him the victory, with 53 percent voting for Trump. So basically, Trump won because of older white people, according to @nytimes & @cnn analyses of exit polling pic.twitter.com/rkfXLWixau If millennials had been the only voters, it would have been a landslide victory for Clinton in the Electoral College. Instead, however, they were in the minority, making up only 44 percent of voters on Tuesday. This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision. pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869 There is one place that the popular vote does matter, however: third parties. If a third-party candidate receives 5 percent of the vote, then their party is eligible to receive federal grants from the Federal Election Commission in the 2020 general election. Unfortunately for Libertarian Gary Johnson (less than 4.1 million), Green Jill Stein (just over 1.2 million) and independent Evan McMullin (about 423,000), none of them reached the necessary milestone. If all their votes were to be combined, they would come to just under 5.7 million, or about half a million votes short. '],\n",

              "  \"The yearly manned space flights, part of Russia’s moon exploration program, will include flyovers and landings on the lunar surface. In order to achieve these goals, Russia plans to use a new type of a manned spacecraft called the Federatsiya (Federation). Russian space rocket corporation Energia will start construction of the spacecraft and software development this summer, the company’s chief designer told journalists. The Federatsiya will be a new generation vessel to replace the currently used Soyuz spaceships. It is designed for transferring people and delivering cargo to the moon and the International Space Station (ISS). Its crew will be four to six cosmonauts. The spaceship is expected to be able to operate autonomously for up to 30 days. It can be deployed to the ISS for up to one year. The testing of the spacecraft is expected to start in 2021, with an unmanned flight launched from Russia’s new Vostochny spaceport in the Far Eastern Amur region. The first test will be followed by two more launches in 2023, including one manned flight. The Angara A5B heavy carrier rocket will be used for the launches, TASS reports. Earlier, it was reported that Federatsiya test flights will include four launches, two of which will be manned and one will involve a flyover of the moon. Energia Corporation has already unveiled another project designed for a potential lunar trip. The company presented draft plans for a new reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the ISS and the moon called the Ryvok (Charge of Breakthrough) at the Human Space Exploration international conference in Korolev, near Moscow, on May 26. The Ryvok spacecraft will be permanently based on the ISS – or its descendant – and will serve as the mid-way shuttle for delivering cargo and crews to the moon, the representatives of the company said at the conference, adding that Ryvok will be much more cost efficient compared to the Federatsiya spacecraft. The Energia Corporation and NASA are also discussing a project to create a joint space station orbiting the moon, which could be put into operation by the end of the next decade, Energia's representative Yuri Makushenko told journalists at the conference. The new space station will have accommodation and energy modules as well as nodes and spaceships, he added. The new station is expected to become a transport hub for maintenance, communications and navigation of the lunar missions and for un-manned missions to Mars and the asteroid belt between the Red Planet and Jupiter. \"],\n",

              "  \"Sunday’s general election Russia saw people vote for members of the lower house, the State Duma and several regional heads. With almost all the votes counted, the ruling United Russia party is likely to secure the majority of seats in the Duma. It's followed by the Russian Communist party (KPRF) and the Liberal Democrats (LDPR), who are neck and neck. Fair Russia has also made it to the lower house with about 6 percent of the votes. The result of the vote didn’t come as any surprise. Various polls and analysts predicted United Russia was going to remain the majority party. However, Western media criticized the election dubbing it “a show” and “a farce” even before it started. Yvan Blot, former member of the French and European Parliaments, says this election result reminded him of the French presidential elections when Charles de Gaulle “had 50 percent of the votes.” “It is the same now in Russia with United Russia, Putin’s party. What strikes me is that all political parties in the majority and in the opposition are patriotic. It is not the case in France, I must admit,” he told RT. Former French MP Blot, commenting on the matter said Western countries should mind their own election process. State Duma elections start in Russia https://t.co/bQvOEODkBO For instance, in France, the system “is less democratic than the Russian one,” he said. He referred to the way Russian lawmakers are elected to the Duma: half of the MPs are elected from single-mandate districts (one candidate per district), the other half - from party candidate lists on a proportional basis. “In France we have a more simple system: every candidate comes from a constituency. But constituencies were designed by the most powerful party some years ago. With the result of 1/3 of the votes the National Front has only two members of Parliament. Is that democratic? It is not democratic at all. It is the same for the extreme left. [It] has very few members of Parliament, but they have voices,” he said. “Besides, candidates in France are selected in general by little committees of oligarchs within political parties. We have no primaries, except now in the Republican Party Presidential election. But in general it is not a tradition to have primaries,” Blot said. Primaries had not been a common thing for Russia either until this year, when ahead of the September 18 parliamentary vote, United Russia held nationwide primaries. The third “big problem” in France, according to Blot, is that opinions of political leaders differ from those of voters. “For that reason people are very deceived by all political parties. In France the rate of trust for a political party is only 18 per cent of the people. I think we have no lesson to give to Russia about democracy. Russia is not perfect – perfection doesn’t exist in the world. But I think the system has much improved since some years and now it is more democratic than in France,” the former MP said. Adam Garrie, author at The Duran says the Western media painted the Russian vote “as a show” because they “don’t want to admit that the democracy in Russia is indeed one of the most vibrant and, more importantly, diverse in the free world”. “When you just listen to some of the many debates in the Duma, you’ve got a broader range of opinions than you’ve got in the British Parliament, in the US Congress, or most places in Europe,” he told RT. In recent years, the Russian government has introduced a number of changes to make elections more representative. For instance, the threshold for parties to get into parliament was lowered to 5 percent and a prominent human rights activist, Ella Pamfilova was appointed to head the Central Election Commission. Garrie explains Western media have an agenda, “and the agenda doesn’t rely on the facts”. “The fact of the matter is that the Russian government has gone out of its way to make this one of the most widespread free and fair elections possible from opening polling stations in some of the most remotest parts of the world – to videotaping all the polling stations to catch any possible irregularities when and as they happen. This factual truth isn’t something that seems to match the Western narrative – that says the Russian electoral system is somehow backwards or undemocratic. Perhaps they are ashamed that the Russian system is slightly more democratic and certainly more ideologically and personally diverse than a lot of place in the so-called West,” he said.\\xa0 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'According to an official notification from the national RTA SE media body, the suspension will come into force in 60 days. The channel will be excluded from free transmission, but will still remain in paid TV packages. The media governing body expressed its “gratitude” for a fruitful cooperation and the contribution of RT Spanish to the national satellite and digital broadcasts in a letter signed by RTA’s Maria Eugenia Martinez, who emphasized that current notification of suspension “does not prevent the conclusion of other future partnerships.” On June 7, a similar letter was sent to the pan-Latin American terrestrial and satellite television network TeleSUR TV, notifying that its broadcasting in Argentina would be suspended within 15 days. TeleSUR President Patricia Villegas denounced the move as “censorship” on the part of the right-wing Argentine president Mauricio Macri and his government. Both letters cited the “need to renew the program listings” of Argentina’s Experimental System of Digital Terrestrial Television and Satellite Television Systems as the reason for suspensions. Censura @mauriciomacri a @teleSURtv#NoNosCallarán#TeleSURConArgentinapic.twitter.com/Mxb3l9UfE9 “The official explanation has been that they need those channels presently occupied by the RT Spanish signal, and also the TeleSur Venezuela signal. The government is saying, officially, that they need those two frequency slots to transmit provincial channels, channels from Argentinian provinces, for example Tierra del Fuego which is way down in the South,” said international political analyst and RT contributor Adrian Salbuchi. “But that is hardly a credible explanation of any sort whatsoever.” READ MORE: RT and Venezuela TeleSUR journalists unite to provide fresh perspective on news “RT and also TeleSUR… definitely [have] a very alternative view on international politics, finance, economic treaties, for example like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so forth… regrettably, what we are seeing at least in Argentina is a case of censorship where the government does not want alternative viewpoint… to be heard by the Argentinian population,” Salbuchi added. OP-EGDE: ‘RT broadcast halt in Argentina is all-out psychological onslaught on Latin America’ “I think that part of this is an effort to deny the citizens of Argentina the opportunity to hear a plurality of voices about what is taking place in other countries in the region,” believes RT Spanish “Behind the News” host and attorney Eva Golinger. “This is a government that has just completed six months in office. It’s a really narrow timeframe, and yet they’ve already taken harsh measures… TeleSUR may have had a more critical voice towards the government, but this is a government that ran on a platform saying they were promoting wider democracy and more freedoms in Argentina. And now we are seeing that what they are actually doing is the opposite.” Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Upper House committee for foreign affairs, said that the main reason for RT’s suspension “is the shift in the power in Argentina” after pro-American Mauricio Macri became president in late 2015. According to the official, the move is one of the first signs of Argentina’s rapprochement with the US. “The US always and everywhere are trying to consistently monopolize the information realm and remove all other alternative sources of information. We know how concerned the US authorities are by the popularity of RT,” Kosachev stressed. The decision to launch RT’s Spanish-language channel as part of the Latin American country’s national television broadcast in 2014 was applauded by the presidents of Russia and Argentina. “Harsh information wars and the attempts of some countries to monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests have become a sign of modern times,”\\xa0President Vladimir Putin said at the time, stressing that “in these circumstances alternative sources of information are particularly in demand. RT is definitely one of them.” Former Argentinian leader\\xa0Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\\xa0also praised the initiative back in 2014 saying, “we are really glad to welcome RT Spanish in Television Digital Terrestre (TDA), which is available all over the country.”  '],\n",

The majority of the thousands of extra staff hired as contractors are thought to come from the private sector, according to the newspaper. “They are all security-vetted and sworn to secrecy.” David Davis, a Conservative Party MP, told the Times that secrecy surrounding GCHQ’s numerical strength was “a bad opening chapter to this new era of transparency.” A spokesperson for GCHQ declined to give exact numbers of those employed in the agency and its partners. \"The total number of people working for or with GCHQ constantly fluctuates due to the complex challenges we face and the threats we aim to counter,\" the spokesperson told IBTimes UK, adding: \"In a complex organization like GCHQ, as you would expect, our core mission is supported by a range of partners including industry and the military.” GCHQ employed 5,683 full-time staff in August 2014, according\\xa0to official figures from the UK parliament\\'s Intelligence and Security Committee. MI5 had 3,926 and MI6 2,430 employees.\\xa0 “We should be asking why are these numbers so secret? And who is paying for all these people?

In November, UK Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hire over 1,900 new spies, citing growing security concerns. \"We need to do more to ensure our agencies have the resources and the information they need to prevent and disrupt plots against this country at every stage. So in next week\\'s strategic defense and security review, we will make a major additional investment in our world class intelligence agencies. This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counter-terrorism experts in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,\" Cameron said. \"We will also more than double our spending on aviation security around the world with more experts overseas working side by side with host nations in the most vulnerable locations. We also need to do more to make sure the powers we give our security services keep pace with changes in technology,\" he added.

The actions \"could amount to war crimes,\" he warned. Government-held West Aleppo has been under constant fire from the rebel-controlled East for several weeks now with many civilians, including children, falling victim to the attacks. RT: Do you think there will be, at some point, an official investigation into human rights violations committed by rebel groups as they continue with their attacks on western Aleppo? Jim Jatras: Well, there certainly should be and the question whether they will be is very difficult to answer because, remember, these are groups supported by the US and other Western countries and by our allies in the region - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so forth. Despite the fact that these are terrorist groups, that they are Al-Qaeda and their various allies, and they are very reluctant to put a spotlight on the kind of people that we’re supporting in this region. Let’s remember, a couple of months ago the Al-Zinki group was alleged of using chlorine gas. And the State Department spokesman was asked, ‘if we were shown [that] they used chlorine gas, would we drop our support for them?’ And he refused to answer. So I’m afraid we’re going to see a roadblock put in by Western governments to avoid that kind of investigation. RT: If they continue to commit what may amount to war crimes, could the rebels lose Western support? In terms of public opinion, is there any chance we\\'ll start seeing a shift in attitude toward armed opposition groups in Syria? JJ: It is certainly out of the bag for people who watch RT and who tune into alternative media. But as far as the American mainstream media goes, it is not out of the bag at all. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups. I would be very interested to see in the very next couple of days, will the American and other Western European mainstream media report this and pin the blame where it belongs - on these terrorists and on the governments that are supporting them. RT: Are the attacks and potential war crimes receiving sufficient coverage to sway public opinion? JJ: Absolutely not. These attacks are not new, these attacks against West Aleppo have been going on continuously and they receive zero reporting in the Western media. I monitor the American media pretty closely, and look at the double standards on how they report on say the offensive against Mosul versus the offensive against East Aleppo. They are night and day difference and I have not heard any reports of terrorist attacks on West Aleppo in the American media. RT: In their latest assault, it appears the rebels used chlorine gas. Where are they likely to have acquired such weapons or the materials required for their assembly? JJ: We’ve had a couple of instances with sarin, for example. There have been allegations in the past that this has been done inside Turkey. I am not in a position to verify that, but given that that’s the main route of the supply for the terrorists, that would be a reasonable speculation to start with. Moderate radical groups are like a Trojan Horse that Western countries and the Gulf States put inside Syria, says Dr. Said Sadiq, professor of political sociology at the American University of Cairo. RT: Staffan de Mistura has condemned the rebel’s actions in Aleppo. Will Western politicians and media now shift their attention to the atrocities the rebels are committing? Dr. Said Sadiq: Despite the fact that not Mistura alone but also the UN Secretary General also condemned what is happening, but all Western media attention is going now to the battle of Mosul in Iraq and what is happening in Aleppo is being sidestepped and played down in international media… RT: Today there was a chemical gas attack in western Aleppo. Will the West reassess its support for these so called moderate groups if it is confirmed the rebels conducted it? SS: We have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf States invested in those moderate radical groups and so they cannot abandon them. They are like the Trojan Horse that they had put inside the Syrian domestic situation. They cannot pull out now and say: “Okay, we discovered that we were wrong, let’s get out and leave them.” They have invested in them and they will still use them in bargaining in the future of Syria. So, if there are any future negotiations on the fate of Syria, those people, these cards of radicals and moderates will be used on the negotiating table. I don’t think that they will get rid of them soon. Secondly, how did they get all those chemical weapons? The Gulf States provide weapons but they don’t have chemicals. So, most likely the chemical weapons had come from a NATO country. Because these are the only countries that have such kind of weapons. How did these chemical weapons come to the Syrian rebels? You will have the usual suspect –Turkey. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups.\\xa0 RT: The UK plans to launch a new program to train rebels and supply them with weapons. Last year a similar program was a complete failure and ended up with the rebels fighting alongside ISIS and Al-Nusra. Will the same happen again? SS: Six years of wasted resources and money to destroy Syria and they failed. The objective that was declared: “We will topple the Assad regime.” Six years and nothing happened. Do you think that one more year or more investment will tip the iceberg and change what we have seen? I doubt it. I think it was wasted money and they had one strategic aim: They don’t want the gas coming from Qatar to cross Syria to Europe and also to destroy the Syrian society, not the Syrian regime, Syrian society, the Syrian army, Syrian territorial integrity.

The attacker knocked her down and was about to assault her when she used pepper spray to defend herself, forcing him to flee the scene.

Horton was thrust into the spotlight at this summer\\'s Olympics in Rio after sparking outrage by accusing China\\'s Sun Yang of being a drug cheat. Speaking to the media after beating Sun by just 0.16 seconds to win the 400m freestyle gold, Horton described his win as one \"for the good guys.\" Yang served a three-month ban for testing positive for a banned substance in 2014, although he claimed he was using the medication to treat a heart condition. Horton\\'s comments attracted a mass of criticism, with one of his Instagram photos bombarded with 500,000 comments – the majority being messages of hate from Chinese people. '],\n",

It revealed a network of ancient cities between 900 and 1,400 years old, with some as big as Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh, according to The Guardian. The data, captured in 2015, suggests the Khmer empire would have been the largest in the world during the 12 century.\\xa0 Evans first carried out a light detection and ranging study in 2012, and the project received funding from the European Research Council as a result.\\xa0 The 2012 study revealed connections between Angkor Wat and other temple cities like Koh Ker. It also confirmed the presence of Mahendraparvata, a city beneath Mount Kulen, and the more recent survey revealed the scale of that city. Water systems were also discovered, which shows the technology was used hundreds of years earlier than previously believed.\\xa0 David Chandler, emeritus professor at Monash University in Melbourne and one of the leading experts on Cambodian history, described the findings as “game-changing,” saying it had succeeded in “putting hundreds of nameless, ordinary, Khmer-speaking people back into Cambodia’s past.” The new discovery also debunks a previously held theory that suggested the Khmer had fled from the area when the Thais invaded in the 15th Century. “That didn’t happen, there are no cities [revealed by the aerial survey] that they fled to. It calls into question the whole notion of an Angkorian collapse,” Evans said.

Intellectually, I am stimulated.” Although the collected data will take years to fully analyze, the discovery is sure to reveal more about the Khmer empire and provide a boost to Cambodian tourism.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  '“The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,” Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, adding that it was done deliberately and on purpose. “This idea was planted into the US public consciousness… with only one goal… to protect the interests of the Democratic candidate in her competition with the candidate of the Republicans, in this case – with Mr. Trump,” the Russian president stressed. The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. “The ‘Russian card’ has been used to demonize one particular candidate – to tie him with Russia, which is not particularly popular in the US at the moment and therefore to diminish his prospects,” former British diplomat Alastair Crooke told RT. He also warned that the deliberate “demonization of Russia in every aspect” used as a political tool during the US presidential campaign will have “a substantive long-term effect on the relations, whoever will be president.” “It will make it very, very difficult for [the future US president] to start a new relationship with the Russian president afterwards,” Crooke stressed. His words were partly echoed by writer John Wight, who told RT that accusing Russia of meddling with the US election process on behalf of Donald Trump is “reckless and very dangerous because whoever will be the next president, he or she is going to deal with Russia.” At the same time, Wight stressed, “it is in the interest of the US people as well as of the people of the whole world that the US reset relations with Russia.” Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. “He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin.

The currency now joins the big four: the US dollar, the euro, the yen, and the British pound. The decision means the Chinese yuan will now be used as one of the International Monetary Fund’s lending currencies in times of emergency economic bailouts. This sort of internationalization is in line with China’s wish for increased legitimacy of its currency. The move is also evidence of China’s growing role as a power to challenge the global economic dominance of the United States. The limitations China places on its own markets, however, have themselves been to blame for this delayed outcome. “It’s an irreversible path towards opening up, integrating into the global economy and playing the economic game by the rules,” proclaimed IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde.

The people behind the project say these are the first indoor farming installations of their kind, placed directly in supermarkets. \"Imagine a future where cities become self-sufficient in their food production, where autonomous farms grow fresh premium produce at affordable prices, eliminating waste and environmental impact,\" INFARM says. The farms look like a tiny greenhouse inside the store where shoppers can pick their own freshly harvested salad greens and herbs right from the growing plants. The advantages of the indoor micro-farms are lower transport costs and associated emissions. They use less water, energy and space than conventional farms and horizontal greenhouses. The vertical greenhouses currently grow only herbs and salad greens but the company says they can be reconfigured to growing other crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and others. INFARM’s Berlin pilot program with vertical mini-farms will end in six months after which the company plans expanding into other supermarket locations. It is also considering putting similar modules into restaurants and hotels which want to offer something unique to their clients and guests. INFARM began several years ago as an indoor urban farming startup with an origami-inspired micro-garden project.

              "  'WADA says athletes who are found to have less than 1 mcg of meldonium in doping tests carried out before March 1, 2016, could be allowed to compete again. Tennis player Maria Sharapova and swimmer Yulia Efimova were two of around 40 Russian athletes who failed drug tests for meldonium.\\xa0 “If the anti-doping organization finds that the athlete could not reasonably have known or suspected that the substance would still be present in his/her body on or after 1 January 2016, then a finding of no fault or negligence may be made,” a press release\\xa0from WADA stated.\\xa0 However, WADA said this was not an “amnesty,” rather it was an acceptance that organizations should take occurrences on a case by case basis. \"In no way does this serve as an \\'amnesty\\' for athletes that are asserted to have committed an anti-doping rule violation,\" WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told AP in an email. \"Rather, it serves as guidance for how anti-doping organizations should assess the particular circumstances of each individual case under their jurisdiction.\"\\xa0 In the statement, WADA admitted that more tests need to be carried out to find out how long meldonium can remain in the blood stream, a point which has been argued by Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko.\\xa0 “In the case of meldonium, there is currently a lack of clear scientific information on excretion times. For this reason, a hearing panel might justifiably find (unless there is specific evidence to the contrary) that an athlete who has established, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she ingested meldonium before 1 January 2016, could not reasonably have known or suspected the meldonium would still be present in his or her body on or after 1 January 2016. In these circumstances, WADA considers there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,” the statement continued.\\xa0 WADA can confirm there have been 172 Adverse Analytical Findings (positives) for Meldonium since it was banned on 1st January 2016 #WADA Athletes around the world were told meldonium was to be added to WADA’s list of banned substances in September 2015, while the ban came into effect on January 1, 2016.\\xa0 One of those who is set to gain from WADA’s decision is Sharapova. She said she had been taking meldonium for more than a decade because of health problems and was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in March after announcing she had failed a test at the Australian Open in Melbourne. However, the Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev said Sharapova’s ban could be addressed in a meeting with ITF head David Haggerty later this month. “The situation with Sharapova could be resolved after April 21 when we meet with the head of the international federation. After that all should be become clear. It is too early to talk about Sharapova competing at the Olympic Games,” TASS quoted Tarpishchev as saying, as cited by Reuters. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was happy that WADA had been flexible regarding meldonium in a statement on its website, as cited by TASS.\\xa0 “The Russian Sports Ministry supports and welcomes the decision made by WADA because it has showed a willingness to understand the situation, rather than stick to the rulebook. They were ready to study how long it would take for meldonium to be eliminated from the body of an athlete. WADA has sent recommendations to all the anti-doping organizations, which will allow them to make fair decisions based on the actual guilt of an athlete. In doing so, WADA has demonstrated impartiality and being objective in the fight against doping.”\\xa0 The five-time speed skating world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov and the 2014 Olympic short track gold medalist Semen Elistratov are two athletes who are set to benefit from WADA’s ruling, and the president of the Russian Speed Skating Union Aleksey Kravtsov told R-Sport that the pair should be allowed to compete again.\\xa0 “These sportsmen should be allowed to fall under the amnesty due to the amount found in their doping tests. They were not guilty, as we had been saying earlier. This is of course good news, but there is still a bit of a cloud hanging over all of this,” he said. '],\n",

The attack follows the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old black man, Alton Sterling, by two white police officers in Baton Rouge earlier in July. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake responded to a call that a man was allegedly using a gun to threaten another man outside a convenience store. Following the arrival of the police, Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point-blank range. The two officers, who are both currently suspended, claimed Sterling reached for a gun before being shot at by law enforcers. In a video recording of the incident, one of the officers, presumably Salamoni, shouted “He’s got a gun! Gun!” prompting his partner to pull out his service pistol and fire several shots. The US Department of Justice is leading a criminal investigation into the case, joined by the FBI and state police of Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Baton Rouge Police Department over the response to the protests that followed. “The lawsuit alleges that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to disperse protesters who were gathered peacefully to speak out against the police killing of Alton Sterling,” the ACLU said in a statement. The shooting led to massive protests against police violence in the US. One of the demonstrations spilled into yet more bloodshed. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 while guarding a rally against excessive use of force by police. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Micah Johnson, used a sniper rifle while targeting officers in what was reported to be a revenge attack for police killings of black people. \"We\\'re convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement – make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement\\'s efforts to punish people of color,\" Dallas Police Chief David said following the incident. Following a standoff with law enforcers Johnson was shot dead. He had served as a reservist in the army until April 2015 and was also deployed to Afghanistan from November 2003 to July 2014. Officials noted that they did not believe the man was part of a terrorist organization and that the assault was a lone-wolf attack. '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  ' “This is political rhetoric that does not have great significance and does not take into account the real situation in Syria,” Putin told French TV channel TF1 during an interview in the central Russian city of Kovrov, when asked about the accusations that have been leveled by Francois Hollande, UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, and the Obama administration. Putin then accused the West of destabilizing the region – citing the Arab Spring in 2011 as a key flashpoint for tensions that still dominate the Muslim world. “I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries,” said Putin. “Remember how everyone rushed to support the Arab Spring? Where is that optimism now? How did it all end? Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our western partners’ forces?” Putin linked the volatility in the region to the recent spate of large-scale terrorist attacks in the West, which have either been planned or inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have thrived in the chaos. “[Before the Arab Spring] these Middle Eastern countries were not examples of democracies as we understand the word today, and there probably was a need and possibility to influence these societies’ organization, the state organization, and the nature of these regimes,” said Putin, who was attending a festival dedicated to Sambo, a Russian combat sport. “But whatever the case, these states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d’Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.” Putin also detailed his version of the breakdown of the long-negotiated joint operation between Washington and Moscow in Syria, claiming the key turning point was the September 16 US-led coalition strike on a Syrian army unit, which the Pentagon maintains was accident. “Our American colleagues told us that this airstrike was made in error. This error cost the lives of 80 people and, also just coincidence, perhaps, ISIS took the offensive immediately afterwards. At the same time, lower down the ranks, at the operations level, one of the American military service personnel said quite frankly that they spent several days preparing this strike. How could they make an error if they were several days in preparation?” said Putin. “This is how our ceasefire agreement ended up broken. Who broke the agreement? Was it us? No.” Several western powers have since blamed Russia for what they claim was a retaliatory strike on a UN convoy on September 20. Washington has now broken off any bilateral talks with Moscow over Syria. But Putin says that Russia is still open to helping resolve what the UN has termed the worst humanitarian crisis since the war – which has likely killed over 400,000 people – began five years ago. “It has been proposed that our armed units, Russian military personnel, be deployed on the road to ensure transit safety [for aid convoys to Aleppo]. The Russian military, who are courageous and decisive people, have said they would do it,” said Putin, who said that the initiative, which had not previously been made public, was an “exotic proposal.” “But I told them that this could only be done jointly with the US, and ordered them to make the proposal. We have proposed this, and they [the Americans] promptly refused. They do not want to deploy their troops there, but they also do not want to pull back opposition groups – who are, in fact, terrorists. What can we do in this situation?” Despite the downbeat tone of the interview, Putin insisted he was still “optimistic” about a diplomatic solution in Syria, and claimed that the offer to “reschedule” next week’s visit to France, which was canceled following a diplomatic snub by Francois Hollande, was genuine. “This is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo. But we are always open, of course, to any consultations and dialogue on this matter,” said Putin. WATCH MORE:  '],\n",

              "  'Ankara has demanded to have comedian Jan Boehmermann prosecuted for insulting a foreign head of state.\\xa0 Under a section of Germany\\'s criminal code, the government has to authorize prosecutors to pursue a case against the comedian. The code, known as Paragraph 103, concerns insults against organs or representatives of foreign states. However, it is so rarely used that many German politicians and lawyers were previously unaware of its existence. \"Turkey has demanded prosecution of Jan Boehmermann. [The] German government, in accordance with established practice, studied the note; this process involved the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Office of the Federal Chancellor. As a result, the federal government in regard to this incident, satisfies the request,\" Merkel told reporters\\xa0at the\\xa0Chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor went on to stress that it \"means\\xa0neither a prejudgment of the person affected nor a decision about the limits of freedom of art, the press and opinion.\" Merkel said that the government intends to repeal the law, effective in 2018.\\xa0 \"There were different opinions between the coalition partners - the conservatives and the SPD (Social Democrats),\" Merkel added. On Friday, German politicians from the “Green” party criticized Merkel\\'s decision to satisfy Ankara’s request, branding it a political mistake. “I believe Merkel’s decision is a political mistake. She has set up a trap for herself by politicizing the case, now she has to live with the accusation that the deal with Turkey [over the refugee crisis] became more important to her than freedom of speech,” Anton Hofreiter, head of the Green party, told TV channel N24. “Merkel should have made it clear from the start that we in Germany have a free press, while Erdogan should take better care of the press at home.” The head of the Social Democratic Party, Thomas Operman, also condemned Merkel’s move.\\xa0 “This decision is wrong. Prosecution of satire due to “lese-majeste” does not correspond with modern democracy,\" Operman wrote on Twitter. The German Union of Journalists (DJV) in their turn said such measures proposed by the chancellor do not correspond with German laws, adding that Merkel gave the “wrong signals” on the case to the Turkish government. “There was no need for the decision since the Turkish president has already filed a complaint to the Mainz Prosecutor.” On Monday, Erdogan filed a private lawsuit before sending a note to the German government demanding criminal prosecution of the presenter. Boehmermann read the\\xa0poem on Germany\\'s ZDF television two weeks ago. Although the\\xa0broadcaster withdrew the piece from its archives,\\xa0it said that no laws were broken. However, Boehmermann warned ahead of time that the reading would breach regulation on insulting foreign leaders.\\xa0 The Turkish government says the poem accused Erdogan of\\xa0“repressing minorities, kicking Kurds, and slapping Christians while watching child porn.” Turkey\\'s own press freedom has come under serious attack in recent months, including from Germany.\\xa0 In March, Ankara reportedly\\xa0pressured\\xa0Berlin into removing a satirical clip aired by public broadcaster NDR, which criticized the president for his crackdown on freedom of speech, as well as the alleged shuffling of electorate votes and cracking down on women. Earlier that month,\\xa0a correspondent for Germany\\'s Der Spiegel magazine was forced\\xa0to leave Turkey after his press credentials weren\\'t removed. The publication\\'s editor-in-chief accused Ankara of violating press freedom. Also last month, employees of Turkey\\'s Zaman newspaper said\\xa0they “feel like captives” following the government\\'s takeover of the daily. Since the paper\\'s seizure, it has has turned into a government mouthpiece, with the first edition under the new ownership immediately featuring a picture of Erdogan.\\xa0 Meanwhile, two journalists from Turkey\\'s Cumhuriyet newspaper are being charged with espionage after publishing a report in 2014 which purported to show Turkey\\'s state intelligence agency helping to transfer weapons into Syria by truck. The two spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the Constitutional Court ruled in February that their pre-trial detention was a violation of their rights. The journalists\\' detainment prompted criticism from international human rights groups, as well as from the EU and US Vice President Joe Biden, who said that Turkey was setting a poor example for the region by intimidating the media.

Asked whether “the federal government has the refugee situation under control,” 81 percent of Germans answered “No,” with just 18 percent saying “Yes.” Those answering “No” also included members of Merkel’s Christian Social Union, with a notable 67 percent of the party’s voters unhappy with the chancellor’s policies. Voter support for Merkel’s government dropped from 57 percent in July 2015 to 38 percent on February 2016 – “the worst estimate during the current government’s term,” the pollster said. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which advocates an anti-immigrant agenda became the third most influential party. It was projected to get 12 percent of the vote if the federal election were held this Sunday. Most Germans also think more restrictive measures towards refugees and asylum seekers must follow. A remarkable 88 percent believe the government should curb benefits for refugees who fail or are unwilling to integrate into German society, with 10 percent saying “No” – a measure previously announced by Germany’s Labor Minister Andrea Nahles. Introducing tougher border control on the EU’s external frontiers and a more detailed processing of asylum seeker applications, debated over the past months in Germany, was also widely supported. Some 63 percent said “Yes” to install the EU’s external border, while 33 percent were opposed. Consequently, 53 percent of Germans said border controls within EU countries – seen as threatening the Schengen border-free zone by many in Brussels – should be introduced as well. According to 77 percent of respondents Europe must also set up refugee centers at the EU’s external borders to process migrants’ applications and send back ineligible asylum seekers. The poll came alongside the so-called “Asylum package II” (Asylpaket II) – the newest set of measures by the German government designed to toughen refugee policies. The package includes putting limits on the number of asylum seekers admitted to Europe, and also an attempt to integrate those who have already reached Germany.

READ MORE: ‘American exceptionalism’ hampers its war on terror – Lavrov “Any unbiased and educated person would see that this statement by Obama is an almost exact copy of leading politicians and propaganda specialists of the Third Reich, including Adolph Hitler… In essence, Obama is using the exact same thing that Nazi bosses said about the German exceptionalism when they started the world war,” he added. The judge also said that in his view the exceptionalism concept had direct influence on the modern US concepts of military planning and these concepts see the main objective of all activities as reaching such degree of military might that the United States remains out of reach of other nations, on land, sea, in air and in space. According to Zorkin, the same applies to the US doctrines on development of mass media and electronic communications – the US authorities see their goal as establishing absolute global domination of their country in the global information space. This idea also constantly appears in Obama’s public speeches. “Obama says that Americans and the USA are an exceptional people and an exceptional state and thus they can pretend for much more than any other people or state. In other words, he follows the plot of James Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ dystopia and, while formally not rejecting the principle of equality of sovereign states and peoples, fixed by the UN Charter, he still declares that Americans and America are ‘more equal’ than any other country and the rest of the planet’s population,” RIA Novosti quoted the judge as saying. Zorkin also told his colleague at the forum that he considered such approach to be a blatant violation of international legal norms. Russian politicians and officials have repeatedly addressed the topic of American exceptionalism when talking on bilateral relations with the US and of international politics in general. In particular, in mid-2015 President Vladimir Putin said in his speech before the UN General Assembly that attempts to influence internal politics of sovereign nations should not be tolerated regardless of where they are taking place and who are making such attempts.

              "  \"Popular among fans, the 3-on-3 format for overtime periods was adopted by the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2015-2016 season, replacing the 4-on-4 format that the league had been using since the 1999-2000 season. Before that, overtime periods were played by the whole lines, with three forwards and two defensemen. The reduction of the number of skaters on the ice creates more open spaces, which allows players to get into the attacking zone easier and place more shots on the net, and significantly increases the chances to score. “The decision was unanimous,” said KHL President Dmitry Chernyshenko, TASS reported. “That format is used around the world, all around Europe. Hockey will become more entertaining.” The innovation will be also adopted by the Russian-based Junior Hockey League (MHL) and Women's Hockey League (WHL). The new format will, however, only be used in the regular season. “In the regular season overtimes will be played in the 3-on-3 format, in the playoffs in the 5-on-5 format,” the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's first vice-president, Roman Rotenberg, told TASS. \"],\n",

              "  \"The ongoing large-scale Anakonda-16 NATO military maneuvers in Poland, simulating the repulsion of “Russian aggression” against the country, are counterproductive, Deutsche Welle cited German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper, in an interview to be published Sunday. “Whoever believes that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring security is mistaken,” Steinmeier said ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw beginning July 8. “We are well-advised to not create pretexts to renew an old confrontation,” he emphasized. 'Deadly irony: US calls Russia ‘aggressive’ as NATO creeps eastward' (Op-Edge by Robert Bridge) https://t.co/1k8aZ9k7uI Rather than inflaming the situation further “through saber-rattling and warmongering,” there ought to be more space for dialogue and cooperation with Moscow, Steinmeier said. It would be “fatal to now narrow the focus to the military, and seek a remedy solely through a policy of deterrence,” German FM said, calling to give way to diplomacy instead of military posturing. Calling for dialogue and a diplomatic approach, Steinmeier also mentioned the necessity of maintaining military preparedness of NATO. The alliance should also consider the possibility to “renew discussions about the benefits of disarmament and arms control for security in Europe,” he said. The Anaconda drills have become NATO’s largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War, bringing to Poland over 31,000 troops from 24 NATO member states and “partner nations,” including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and others. Moscow has once again pointed out that augmentation of NATO military presence in Eastern Europe and Baltics is unjustified, stressing that Russia has no plans whatsoever to interfere with any country in the region. “I am convinced that every serious and honest politician is well aware that Russia will never invade any NATO member. We have no such plans,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated. The NATO summit in Warsaw is set to put “Russian threat” issue high on the agenda, as the gathering will be making the final decision on stationing additional NATO troops in Eastern Europe. More NATO troops deployed to Poland will be sending “a clear signal that an attack on Poland will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance,” the bloc’s Secretary General told reporters following his meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June. The statements made by NATO leadership put Russian diplomats in a position where they have to deny the obvious. “During the NATO secretary general’s recent visit to Poland, officials in this country [Poland] made statements suggesting that from now on Russia would know that any attack on Poland would mean an attack on NATO as a whole. This is completely absurd because they are discussing a non-existent problem. There are no plans for any attacks on Poland,” Russian envoy to NATO Aleksandr Grushko said in an interview with TV channel Russia-24. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said that NATO has “an absolutely slapdash attitude to our position on anything,” adding that it was the US that had unilaterally quit the missile defense treaty, which was initially signed to “provide strategic balance in the world.” NATO “needs a foreign enemy, otherwise what would be the reason for the existence of such an organization,” said the Russian leader. The conflict in Ukraine, caused by a bloody coup supported by the US and its European NATO allies, was forced on that country “to substantiate the very existence of the North Atlantic alliance,” the Russian president concluded. Putin assured his audience that he does not want to proceed to a new Cold War, as “no one wants it.”“However dramatic the logic of the development of international relations might seem on the outside, it’s not the logic of global confrontation,” he explained. \"],\n",

The two-day strike is the third since the New Year and was organized after talks between the government and junior doctors broke down, with Hunt deciding to impose the new contract without agreement. Previous strikes have focused on adjustments to pay and overtime working hours, which junior doctors said would leave them working longer hours for less pay, despite the government insisting that the new contract would result in a net pay rise of 13.5 percent.

Many Labour MPs joined picket lines on Wednesday morning, including Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and veteran MP Dennis Skinner.

Baltimore Police Release Details Of New “Use Of Force” Policy https://t.co/y7w67kcsOs Davis added that the “use of force” policy had not been updated since 2003 and that the department had learned much about best practices during that time. The policy changes come as the courts have failed to convict a single officer for the death of Freddie Gray. Gray died from injuries sustained in police custody at the age of 25 when he was improperly secured in the back of a police van. The incident sparked widespread protests against police brutality and prompted the Justice Department to launch an investigation. Six officers were charged, all of whom pleaded not guilty.

A former police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC believes making police officers accountable for other cops’ criminal behavior is a worthwhile idea, but is easier said than done. “It is a good policy. I believe it should be in place. It would be on paper, but whether or not police officers will do it will be another thing, because of the culture of policing in our society,” Ronald Hampton of the National Police Accountability Project told RT America. “It is not about, if you see a police officer doing something wrong, another police officer more than likely would not do anything and [would] come to his or her behalf, rather than report them for doing something improper, or even intervene.” Hampton said the Washington, DC code says that a police officer has a duty to respond or intervene if anyone is committing a crime. It does not exempt police officers. What is missing, however, are protections for officers who choose to blow the whistle on their colleagues, and measures the department should take to prevent officer-on-officer harassment, he added. Hampton thinks it would be more fruitful to codify those measures in the Maryland criminal code. Rawlings-Blake told reporters that city residents never tell her that they want \"an aggressive police department; they say they want an effective police department.\" The announcement of the new policy comes just as the US Justice Department is about to release the results of a sweeping investigation into the Baltimore Police Department’s patterns and practices.

The slowest contraction of the second quarter was seen in June, at 0.5 percent, but excluding seasonal factors like cheaper crops and lower demand for coal and gas, the economy did not shrink during the month, said the ministry. The Ministry of Economic Development has forecast that Russia’s GDP will contract by 0.2 percent this year, improving to zero percent in the third quarter, and 1.2 percent growth in the fourth if oil prices average $40 per barrel. The Finance Ministry doesn’t rule out that the economy will grow if the positive situation in the external economic environment continues through the end of the year. On Thursday, Bloomberg wrote that, based on a poll of its economists, Russia is exiting its longest recession in 20 years. Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. Crude prices fell from $114 in July of 2014 to decade lows of $27 per barrel this January, before rebounding to the $45-$50 range this summer.

It also claimed that then-foreign secretary Philip Hammond had “raised the importance of compliance with IHL with the Saudi Government during his visit to the region late May, emphasising the importance for thorough and conclusive investigations of alleged IHL breaches to be conducted.” The government asserted that it has a “key test” in place in relation to “our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia,” which determines “whether there is a clear risk that the items to be licensed might be used in a serious violation of IHL.” “Having regard to all the information available to us, we assess that this test has not been met. The Government is therefore satisfied that extant licences for Saudi Arabia are compliant with the UK’s export licensing criteria,” it argued. NGOs dealing with Britain’s global arms trade have not taken the government’s response well. Within hours, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) spokesman Andrew Smith issued a statement. “Despite overwhelming evidence that Saudi forces have broken international humanitarian law, the government has continued to arm and support the regime,” he said. “We are always being told how ‘rigorous’ and ‘robust’ UK arms export controls supposedly are, but the decision to keep arming Saudi shows how hollow those words are. There is a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and the UK government has been complicit in it,” Smith added. In early July, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a 59-page report titled “Bombing Businesses: Saudi Coalition Airstrikes on Yemen’s Civilian Economic Structures.” The document made a detailed study of 17 airstrikes on 13 civilian economic sites, including factories, warehouses, a farm, and two power facilities. Those facilities had employed some 2,500 people before the airstrikes, after which many ceased operations. Up to 130 people were killed and 171 injured in the attacks. '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Was it: (a) Vladimir Putin (b) Sergey Lavrov(c) Viktor Yanukovich (d) Jean Claude-Juncker If the correct answer were (a) or (b), western journalists and pro-Kiev regime activists - which are frequently indistinguishable - would be lining up to dismiss the quote as “Russian propaganda.” Or “Hybrid War.” Or whatever this month’s agreed catchphrase/Twitter hashtag is. As it happens, Russia has been consistent on one particular point since Kiev’s ’Orange revolution,’ back in 2004 - that the US's primary objective is to exploit Ukraine’s fratricidal divisions to serve its own geopolitical goals. Which Moscow believes are to push\\xa0American forces as close to Russia’s borders as possible, in the name of ‘containment.’ Two things have prevented this plan from fully succeeding. Firstly Ukraine's internal conflicts. Capital city protestors, aided by Galician allies, have now removed two eastern-dominated governments. The second of which was fairly elected. As sentiment in Kiev and Lviv doesn't reflect the entire country, the regimes these demonstrations created have been unable to consolidate popular, nationwide, support. For example, current President Petro Poroshenko, now enjoys lower\\xa0approval ratings than his ousted predecessor, Viktor Yanukovich, had before Maidan. The other barrier has been many NATO and EU members’ reluctance to countenance full Ukrainian membership of their institutions. Thus, Ukraine is drip-fed with aid, and warm words of praise, while getting no closer to joining either club. It’s instructive to note that NATO is more than willing to supply\\xa0military assistance and funding to Ukraine, but, despite heavy lobbying from the likes of Bernard-Henri Levy, a ‘Marshall plan’-esque economic strategy remains unfathomable to western leaders. We hear plenty of, often bellicose, Washington solidarity with Ukraine’s army, but very little about its pensioners, who are expected to\\xa0survive on average payments of just $14.07 a week, at current exchange rates. This compares to $40.51 in\\xa0Bulgaria and $41.25 in\\xa0Russia, where utilities are significantly cheaper. A guess at (c) would also be incorrect. Yanukovich might have been a terribly corrupt and weak President, but, back in 2013, he did, belatedly, realize one thing: the EU association agreement, which he pulled back from signing, would become an unmitigated disaster for Ukraine. That’s because it involved sacrificing ties with the country’s biggest trading partner, Russia, and replacing them with a far less certain alternative. Free trade with the EU is largely useless to Ukraine, as things stand. For the past two decades, the country’s ruling classes have stolen everything they could, and moved that money\\xa0abroad. As a consequence, there has been little or no investment in modernizing Ukrainian industry. That means its products are of insufficient quality to compete in cutthroat European markets. Confusingly, many activists at Maidan seemed to believe that EU accession was on the cards for Ukraine. It never was. A free trade pact, heavily loaded in Brussel’s favor, was all that was available. By contrast, Russia offered\\xa0$15 billion and a 30% discount on gas. This was in response to an IMF demand that Ukraine raise utility prices and slash public spending in return for a bail-out. Post-coup, Ukraine was forced into the latter scenario by default. Since then, nominal GDP has\\xa0fallen from $183 billion to around $90 billion. Meanwhile, public debt was 94% of GDP in 2015 and annual salaries now average about $2,000, the lowest in Europe. On January 1st, foreign reserves stood at a meagre $12.5 billion. You’re surely guessed by now that (d) Jean-Claude Juncker is our man. The President of the EU Commission was\\xa0speaking in the Netherlands, where a referendum on the EU-Ukraine free-trade agreement will be held in April. While trying to assuage the fears of Dutch voters about more, unpopular, easterly EU expansion, he let the cat out of the bag about where Ukraine stands with Eurocrats. In the heady days of late 2013, EU leaders, like the ultimately deposed, pro-American\\xa0pair of Carl Bildt and Radoslaw Sikorski,\\xa0gave Maidan protestors the impression that Brussels was open to Ukrainian membership. Even now, Kiev has NGOs devoted to EU integration and we’ve heard endless talk of Ukraine’s\\xa0 “European choice.” As an aside, given that the EU only controls 44% of the continent’s land area, it’s endlessly amusing when activists say ‘Europe’ when they mean the EU. Juncker's words, though an example of rare sincerity from a Eurocrat, are a kick in the teeth to Kiev’s EU-integrationists. While he’s merely confirming what smart analysts have already known for a long time, the fact that someone of his stature is openly dismissing Ukrainian ambitions is highly significant. The EU Commission President acknowledged that the EU had enlarged too quickly in the past and insisted Brussels “will not make that mistake again.” Interestingly, it could be argued that the haste to admit Romania and Bulgaria back in 2007, and the British media reaction to it, created the circumstances for this year’s Brexit vote. For that reason, the behavior of the UK authorities during Maidan was always quite amusing. We’ve seen Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond promote the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, while simultaneously admitting he’d\\xa0vote to remove his own country from Brussel's orbit. The hypocrisy is mind blowing. Ukrainians are living under the illusion that their country is on the road to EU membership and acceptance into the western political and economic system. To achieve these aspirations, they are enduring great sacrifices. The problem is that the EU elite doesn’t want Ukraine to join the club. It’s too big, too corrupt, too poor and too close to Russia. It’s time Kiev’s legislative, and oligarchic, elite told their people the truth. Ukraine’s ‘European choice’ is a fraud, built on false promises.

              "  'In a long phone conversation that lasted an hour and twenty minutes, Obama told\\xa0his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the US has an “unwavering commitment” to Turkey’s national security. Obama said he is “concerned” about the Syrian Army’s and Kurdish fighters’ gains in northern Syria as he “urgently called for a halt to actions that heighten tensions with Turkey and with moderate opposition forces in northern Syria,” according to a statement from the White House. The US president stressed that the ongoing advance of Syrian armed forces and Kurdish militia, with support from the Russian Air Force, could “undermine our collective efforts in northern Syria to degrade and defeat ISIL.” While advising Erdogan to show “reciprocal restraint” and avoid shelling northern Syria where Ankara is engaging Kurds, Obama stressed that “YPG forces should not seek to exploit circumstances in this area to seize additional territory.” At the same time both leaders called on Moscow and Damascus to halt airstrikes against what they call “moderate opposition forces.” Russia has on numerous occasions denied striking civilian targets, and has repeatedly offered its air support to opposition fighters. Russia\\'s Foreign and Defense Ministries have also repeatedly asked Washington to provide a list of the groups it considers “moderate” enough. The US also ignored calls to share intelligence on Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) positions or to join a wider coalition of an anti-terrorist force. While the Kurdish groups, supported by the United States in the fight against IS in northern Syria, are considered one of the most effective ground forces in fighting jihadists in the area, Ankara regards them as terrorists. Vowing retaliation in both Syria and Iraq for the Ankara bombing earlier this week, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu promised to continue to bomb the Kurds, including PKK bases in northern Iraq and YPG positions in northern Syria. Ankara also made it clear that it expects cooperation from its NATO allies to assist Ankara in this fight. Following the bombing in Ankara, Erdogan promised to hunt the perpetrators “everywhere” possible. Prior to speaking with Obama, Erdogan announced that American weapons were being used against civilians by the YPG. The State Department has refuted the claims, with spokesman Mark Toner saying: \"We have also seen no evidence to substantiate the claim that the YPG is somehow smuggling US weapons to the PKK.\" Earlier in the day, Washington rejected a Russian draft resolution at the UN Security Council condemning any plans for foreign military intervention in Syria. Ambassador Samantha Power even accused Moscow of trying to “distract the world” with its resolution. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the discussions with Moscow on the ceasefire in Syria are “near-constant” and have been “serious and so far constructive.” “Everyone recognizes the complexity of this endeavor, and there is certainly a lot more work to do. These discussions have been serious and so far constructive, with a few tough issues still to resolve,” Kerry said in London as quoted by Reuters. He has been in contact with the US Syria team, which is in Geneva and said the negotiations have been ongoing for the past 36 hours. “Working out modalities for a cessation of hostilities in a situation like Syria is a highly technical and detailed process; and that\\'s why our teams are still at it. We want this process to be sustainable, and should all participants prove willing to really sit down and work this out, we can get to a cessation of hostilities.” Kerry briefly stopped in London en route to Jordan where he is to discuss Syria with King Abdullah over the weekend. The proximity talks launched in Geneva in February have been delayed with an indefinite date of restart, according to UN special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura. On Friday, de Mistura’s office said it would provide a new date for the meeting in Geneva \"as soon as possible.\" De Mistura told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that the peace talks won\\'t resume in Geneva on February 25 as he had hoped. He said he can’t \"realistically\" get the parties in the Syrian conflict back to negotiations by that time. However, he added that he hopes the parties will gather “soon.” “We need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks. Now the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities,” he said in the interview on Thursday. At the beginning of February, the United Nations temporarily suspended peace talks aimed at resolving Syria’s five-year civil war. The UN said the process was to be resumed on February 25 and called on the sides involved to do more to achieve progress. An ambitious plan to end hostilities in Syria with verifiable results within a week, revived the Geneva-3 peace talks, when Kerry and Lavrov unveiled the truce plan in Munich last Friday. While the humanitarian aid has begun flowing into besieged towns in Syria this week, the warring sides have yet to end hostilities. '],\n",

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'WhatsApp announced Tuesday that messages sent over the service are only stored in a meaningless hash on WhatsApp servers by default. The update took a year and a half to roll out, and affects the messaging service’s billion users. The announcement from the company, which is a subsidiary of Facebook, comes amid something of cold war between Silicon Valley and the US government on matters of encryption and privacy. The highest-profile instance of this faceoff happened between Apple and the FBI, where the government initiated a legal battle to force the company to open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. The litigation abruptly ended last month because the FBI managed to break into the phone using an unknown method without Apple’s help. While the timing may seem perfect in the wake of that controversy, WhatsApp has been in the process of strengthening privacy since November 2014, when it partnered with Open Whisper Systems to implement the nonprofit’s encryption protocols. “The desire to protect people’s private communication is one of the core beliefs we have at WhatsApp, and for me, it’s personal,” Ukrainian-born WhatsApp founder Jan Koum\\xa0wrote in a Tuesday blog post. “I grew up in the USSR during communist rule and the fact that people couldn’t speak freely is one of the reasons my family moved to the United States.” The new privacy standards could affect the messenger’s one billion users, but the end-to-end encryption is reliant on all communicants being upgraded to the software’s latest version. The WhatsApp client will notify users as to whether or not their messages are fully encrypted. While the company’s blog post calls encryption “one of the most important tools governments, companies, and individuals have to promote safety and security in the new digital age,” many in the US government have sought to undermine encryption on the basis of national security concerns. WhatsApp has been in the crosshairs of authorities before, and in March the service’s messaging encryption thwarted a court-approved wiretap. READ MORE: ISIS using Android app to send encrypted messages, plan attacks On Monday, Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that he would soon unveil legislation that would regulate encrypted communications. In July, FBI Director Jim Comey pushed for the tech industry to create “backdoor” keys to bypass encrypted software. In their blog post, WhatsApp’s founders gestured at the government’s enmity with encryption, assuring users that “no one can see inside the message.” “Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us,” the blog post reads. '],\n",

However, his Flyboard Air hoverboard, which can reach speeds of 150kph (94mph), is scarily similar to the comic book supervillain’s Goblin Glider.  Guinness World Records have confirmed that Zapata’s hoverboard managed to cover 2,252 meters at a height of 50 meters near Sausset-les-Pins harbour. READ MORE: Madcap inventor designs bizarre ‘human blender’ hoverbike (VIDEO) The Flyboard Air is manufactured by the Frenchman’s Zapata Racing company, which claims the pod can climb 3048 meters (10,000ft) into the air. Prior to achieving the record on April 30, Zapata warned that the prototype had been working for just four or five weeks. via GIPHY Zapata’s Flyboard is different from his firm’s previous creations in that it is propelled by jets rather than water. Footage of the amazing world record shows the daredevil lifting off from a beach in the south of France.  With a fuel pack on his back, Zapata is filmed gaining some incredible height and speed as a fleet of support boats struggle to keep up. He later told Guinness World Records that the feat was the culmination of “a life’s work”.  “I just dreamed that five years ago but nobody believed it was possible and today to see that we realise our dream is just one of the best moments of my life,” the jet ski champion said. A test flight video released on the Flyboard Air Youtube channel provides a clearer look at the hoverboard’s capabilities, showing that Zapata uses a handheld joystick to maneuver while on the device.

She was released on Sunday, but was ordered to stay in Turkey and report herself to the police on a regular basis, a spokesman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry told RT on Sunday: “So, she is no longer being held in custody, but she is not free to go where she wants to be.” The police “were harsh at first,” and later became “annoyed at my lack of fear and hierarchy,” Umar wrote on her Twitter after the release. Officers at the station made clear that they were just following orders, but refused to give their names, she added.

That’s the result of a gradual decline over several years. According to the National Retail Federation, nearly 102 million customers visited stores over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend last year compared to 147 million in 2012. Consumers haven’t stopped shopping during the Thanksgiving holiday. They just prefer to shop online rather than visiting stores without saving purchases for Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Nearly 137.4 million people are expected to shop in stores and online over the Thanksgiving weekend with spending up 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, according to a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation. Online sales will increase by 7-10 percent against last year to about $117 billion, the study says. However, almost half of American consumers are expected to make all their purchases before Black Friday this year, according to a survey carried out by a Chicago-based advertiser Market Track. The massive Black Friday discounts have been spread across November and December, outshining the effect of the biggest shopping day of the year.A survey of retailers by global accounting network BDO suggests two-thirds expect Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales to remain flat this year.“The question isn’t whether Black Friday is dead: It’s how many Black Fridays are there during the holiday season?” said BDO consumer business leader Natalie Kotlyar, as quoted by Business Insider.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'The Free Syrian Army’s spymaster, codenamed “M”, in an exclusive\\xa0to Le Monde, told the newspaper he had been sending “very detailed reports” on Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), based on field data from his agents, to his CIA contacts for two years. The intelligence gave critical insight into IS’ pivot to Iraq and Syria, and included GPS coordinates, maps, photographs, phone numbers and even IP addresses, \"M\" said. “From the moment Daesh (an Arabic pejorative acronym for IS) had 20 members to when it had 20,000, we have shown everything to the Americans. When we asked them what they did with this information, they always gave evasive answers, saying it was in the hands of decision-makers.” The FSA’s intelligence chief, “trained abroad” according to the newspaper, had recruited thirty trusted men, who were inserted into IS-held cities in Syria, including Raqqa, Al-Bab, Tel Abyad and others. To finance operations, the spy chief requested $30,000 per month from the Americans, but he says he only received $10,000. One of M’s most valuable agents was a mole inside Islamic State’s financial unit in Manbij near the Turkish border. A report from him, seen by Le Monde, described payments of $74,000 (€67,000) from a former parliamentarian called Radwan Habib to his brother Ali – an IS “emir” in Maskaneh in Aleppo governorate. FSA agents and informants conducted various operations, often risky ones. One photo \"M\" shared with the newspaper showed a training camp north of Latakia province frequented by foreign IS fighters. “Naturally I transmitted this to my Western contacts with the GPS coordinates but got no response,” he was cited as saying. “My agents also managed to get hold of phone numbers of IS officials, serial numbers of [their] satellite equipment and IP addresses. But once again, zero response.” Another FSA document accessed by the French newspaper included an order of battle designed to expel IS from Aleppo province in summer 2014. Postponed several times by the Americans, the attack was eventually torpedoed at end of 2014 by a surprise counterattack by Al-Nusra Front. The Free Syrian Army was founded by a group of deserters, including officers and soldiers from the Syrian Army, in July 2011. It received substantial military aid from the US and Britain for its anti-Assad stance. In June 2012, the CIA was involved in clandestine operations along the Turkish-Syrian border, according to a Wall Street Journal report. They were identifying rebel groups to give military aid to. CIA operatives also helped opposition forces develop supply routes and provided communications training. Agents also reportedly distributed assault rifles, anti-tank rocket launchers and other ammunition to the Syrian opposition. Throughout 2013 and 2014, the CIA was said to be training “moderate” Syrian opposition fighters at Jordanian special forces’ bases in anticipation of President Assad’s fall. By 2015, Washington had scaled down most programs to train and equip Syrian rebels. However, other secret and significantly larger programs run by Langley still continue despite significant cuts, the Washington Post reported. '],\n",

              "  'The history of Guantanamo Bay has been marred by accusations of torture of detainees and months-long hunger strikes.\\xa0 Last January, in an unprecedented move, the personal diary of detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi was published, providing a firsthand perspective of life inside the world’s most infamous prison. Slahi’s book, ‘Guantanamo Diary,’ describes in highly redacted yet dramatic style his incredible ordeal from the moment his rendition plane landed in Cuba, where he and other detainees faced abuse, torture and other atrocities. Once on the island, Slahi was forced into solitary confinement where he says he “was on the edge of losing his mind.” The diary describes how Slahi was subjected to sleep deprivation, death threats, sexual humiliation and intimations. Yet Slahi’s revelations are almost singular. The government has prevented other detainees ‒ like Ammar al Baluchi, one of the few men at Gitmo who has been charged with a crime ‒ from talking about what happened to them… even to their own lawyers. The government “has classified Mr. al Baluchi’s own memories of what happened to him, to prevent him from providing information that would allow someone, somewhere to seek accountability,” James Connell, one of al Baluchi’s lawyers, told RT. Exactly 10 years ago Friday, criminal investigators learned of the first deaths from inside Gitmo. “There’s some sort of dark history in the past that has happened before the DOD has taken over and so people have concerns,” Navy Captain Christopher Scholl told RT America. “If you google images for Guantanamo Bay, often images of Camp X-Ray from the first 92 days ‒ 14 years ‒ ago comes up, and the media keeps on using” those images. But now, he says, it’s a completely different picture. Gitmo opened as a prison at the US naval base in Cuba under the administration of President George W. Bush following the attacks of September 11, 2001. President Barack Obama promised during his 2008 campaign that he would close the infamous detention center in Cuba. It’s a promise he’s, as yet, been unable to keep thanks, in part, to strong opposition in Congress. Of the 779 men who have been held there, only 80 detainees remain ‒ 28 of whom are cleared for release ‒ but the conditions they face and what might happen to them in the future remain unclear. For a special report airing Friday, RT America’s Simone Del Rosario went to Guantanamo Bay to investigate if and how the prison would be shut down, and to see in what conditions those detainees are living. What happens, she asks, when you reach the irreducible minimum, the dozens of forever prisoners deemed too dangerous to release? “There’s a distinction between detainees and prisoners, prisoners are held with an objective of rehabilitating them from the behavior that led to the previous crime,” Admiral Peter Clarke, commander of Gitmo, told RT. “These are law of war detainees who are here because at one point they made it their job to try to kill Americans.” The focus now is on what to do with the population, especially as the detainees age. Del Rosario takes a look inside the detention facilities currently being used, to see what the cells look like. She talks to current and former guards deployed at Gitmo, those tasked with taking care of “the worst of the worst.” She also speaks with lawyers for two men who are still detained in Cuba, one who has been cleared for release and one of the few who has actually been charged with a crime. What will happen to them if Obama is able to fulfill his campaign promise during his final days in office? Will the upcoming presidential election change their future?

The problem here is not the Cuba side, it is the US,”\\xa0she added.\\xa0 Tariq Nasheed, documentary filmmaker and activist said that it is very contradictory for President-elect Trump to make that statement about oppression. “We’re living in a system of complete white supremacy here in the US, where black people are totally and completely oppressed. Especially now under Trump, it is going to get more intensified,” he told RT. “There has been the rise of anti-establishment figures all around the globe recently. In the US, for example, Bernie Sanders inspired people with his socialist agenda.” Answering the question if Castro is still a source of inspiration for a new generation of socialists, Nasheed said that Castro has done a lot of great things for African people around the globe. “He helped in apartheid in South Africa. He helped the African nation Angola gain their independence. He helped the African nation Ethiopia fight wars. He offered to help African-American people during Hurricane Katrina, where Black people were floating up and down the streets for a week out here in the US. He offered to help, he was turned down. Castro also offered African-Americans free scholarships to go to Cuba and to get medical training. So he’s reached out to people like Malcolm X. He’s been revered in the Black community globally,” the filmmaker told RT. Solomon Comissiong, host and founder of Your World News Radio Show and Media Collective, told RT that Castro\\'s death and Trump\\'s new presidency are not going to change the future course of relations. “It tells me that it is going to be business as usual. It is going to be the same as it was with all the previous US presidents,” he said.\\xa0 According to Comissiong, the recent President-elect\\'s comments on Castro are reprehensible and littered with lies and hypocrisy. “We look at the US – a country that’s riddled with social injustices, especially against people of color,” he continued. “We look at the fact that before the Cuban Revolution, which was consummated in 1959, before that, Fulgencio Batista was the brutal dictator, and was financed by the US, supported by the US,” Comissiong told RT. “Why? Because he allowed the US government and corporations to come in there and run roughshod and to control mass swaths of natural resources from Cuba,” he added. #Fidel’s death: New round of US vs. #Cuba political football, or The End?

I bet Dr Filthysex is now looking forward to his retirement. Heimlich developed the technique in 1974 after reading numerous reports of people dying after choking on food while in restaurants. There has been confusion, however, over whether this was actually Heimlich’s first time carrying out the maneuver, as he claims. It was reported by the BBC\\xa0in 2003 that the doctor had carried out the procedure while in a restaurant in 2000. There also appears to be confusion within the Heimlich family over whether this was or wasn’t the first time to do this, with one of his sons telling the Cincinnati Enquirer that he recalls previous such incidents, while another said he doesn’t have “a recollection” of other times.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'A cursory glance at Putin’s track record should convince even the most jaded Russian observer that he has done everything possible to build solid relations with the United States. Yet not only has the Obama administration refused to meet Putin halfway, it characterizes the Russian leader as the global arch villain bar none. So here’s a refresher course for anybody who’s ever dragged Putin’s name through the mud, serving up piping hot propa-garbage while helping to exasperate tensions between Russia and the US. As Vladimir Nabokov once proclaimed before considering an entirely different subject, “Look at this tangle of thorns”. It is no secret that following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 against the US, Putin was the first global leader to telephone US President George W. Bush. And he didn\\'t call collect. Moreover, the Russian leader offered more than just words of condolence. He pushed through a raft of legislation to assist the US in the fight against terrorism. In his 2011 book, “Vladimir Putin and Russian Statecraft,” Allen C. Lynch documented Putin’s contributions to America’s endless ‘War on Terror’. “In a bold decision… Putin made Russia the most important U.S. ally in the war against the Taliban,” Lynch wrote. “Among other things, he accelerated deliveries of weapons to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan so that when the Alliance marched into Kabul it did so with Russian, not American, weapons and vehicles. He encouraged the governments of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to allow American military bases on their territory.” And here is my personal favorite: “He opened Russian airspace for American overflights to bases in Central Asia so that the US could conduct search and rescue operations for U.S. airmen (Please imagine the howl of pain that would echo across Washington if any US president allowed Russian military overflights across US territory into South America!). Despite Putin’s extreme generosity bestowed upon the US military and intelligence apparatus, Washington proved Graham Greene’s adage “there is no such thing as gratitude in politics” by ratcheting up pressure against Russia for no good reason whatsoever. According to Stephen Cohen, the US\\xa0repaid Putin for his “extraordinary assistance” by “further expanding NATO to Russia’s borders and by unilaterally withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which Moscow regarded as the linchpin of its nuclear security.”\\xa0 With friends like this who needs enemies? After spending prodigious amounts of money, material and manpower fighting fundamentalists in the desert, some might be tempted to think the US would relish any opportunity to avoid another military misadventure. If you believed that, you haven’t been paying attention to what’s been occurring in the Middle East since 2002 with the US invasion of Afghanistan. Future historians (that is, assuming there is a future where historians may ponder the past) may one day mark August 29, 2013 as the day when the American Empire first started showing signs of wear and tear. That was when UK Prime Minister David Cameron failed to secure approval in the House of Commons to join yet another US-led serial killing, this time in Syria, after President Bashar Assad\\xa0purportedly crossed Obama’s whimsical “red line” and used chemical weapons against the Syrian opposition (an assertion that was never proven). This placed the Obama administration in a bind, eventually leading to a ‘slip of the tongue’ by US Secretary of State John Kerry, who remarked that Syria could avoid an American blitzkrieg if it agreed to surrender its chemical weapons “within one week”. Infuriatingly for the US neocons, Putin successfully\\xa0convinced Damascus to remove its chemical weapons with all due haste. NATO missile defense goes live in Europe, isolating Russia not the goal – Stoltenberg https://t.co/hzCkN3l7yw#WSEF16 Predictably, however, US media and thinktankdom portrayed Putin’s eleventh-hour diplomacy, which delayed the obliteration of yet another Middle East state, as some sort of geopolitical ploy. \"It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,\" Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution,\\xa0told CNN. I was almost expecting Fiona to employ some sort of judo analogy next. Oh wait, she did. \"If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin\\'s favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,\" she said. \"And right now, he\\'s managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.\" Think about that. If that was the best press Putin could get when he helped America to avoid yet another military smash-up, chances are negligible that he would ever get positive reviews under normal circumstances. And therein, dear reader, lies the rub: America has come to the psychotic point in its foreign policy when avoiding military conflict is actually viewed as a setback. In May, the US put the finishing touches on its Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System in Romania, the culmination of a decades-worth of\\xa0disingenuous negotiations with Moscow. Washington’s determination to build this system, which Moscow naturally views as a major security threat smoking on its doorstep, has completely upset the strategic balance in the region. Russia is now forced to respond to this system with more powerful and elusive ballistic missiles. In other words, our tiny, fragile planet, thanks to the surrogate mother of global upheaval and chaos, Lady Liberty, is experiencing the birth pains of another arms race between the world’s two nuclear superpowers. This did not have to be. Early in his presidency, Obama\\xa0announced he would “scrap” the Bush administration\\'s defense system, slated for Poland and the Czech Republic, after it was determined that Iran was not the existential threat to Eastern Europe that his predecessor had touted it as. This seemed to indicate an open window of opportunity for Russia-US cooperation (in fact, the fate of the New START nuclear disarmament treaty, signed into force between Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama on April 8, 2010, hinged on bilateral cooperation). Russia even proposed the two countries share the Qabala Radar in Azerbaijan, which Russia leased at the time, but the US rejected the proposal even though it made more tactical sense. Eventually, it became maddeningly apparent that the US was bluffing, dangling the carrot of mutual cooperation with Russia at the same time a new missile defense system was moving forward. In November, Putin rightly\\xa0accused the US of attempting to “neutralize Russia’s nuclear potential” by camouflaging their real designs behind Iran and North Korea. “The US is attempting to achieve strategic military superiority, with all the consequences that entails,” he said. Obama’s failure to cooperate with Putin on this game-changing system has been the real source of bad blood between the two nuclear superpowers. In September 2015, following an official request by the Syrian government, Russia\\xa0launched a formidable aerial attack on Islamic State positions in Syria. Russia went on to provide ample video evidence of its success against ISIS, not only hitting its command and control centers, but destroying its makeshift oil exporting business. Oddly, Moscow’s request for assistance in providing logistics on terrorist positions was rebuked by Western governments. In fact, the only thing Putin got from the United States for his labors in Syria was a lamentable\\xa0lecture by US Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter: “This will have consequences for Russia itself, which is rightly fearful of attacks,” Carter said before uttering a regrettable prediction. “In coming days, the Russians will begin to suffer from casualties.” Coincidentally, throughout the course of Russia’s military offensive in Syria, it has only lost a single fighter jet and a number of servicemen. But not to Islamic State or some other nefarious group. The jet was shot down by Turkey, the first time a NATO member engaged a Russian aircraft in over 50 years. Despite whatever Monsanto lobbyists may tell our representatives in Congress, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed - on moral, ethical and health grounds - to genetically modified foods. In a survey of US residents representative of the population on gender, age, and income, 64 percent opposed GMO, and 71 percent of GMO opponents said they were “absolutely” opposed—that is, they agreed that GM should be prohibited no matter the risks and benefits. Yet this clear demonstration of public opinion has not translated into any sort of democratic ability to pull GMO ‘Frankenstein foods’ from the shelves. What is all the more incredible about America’s willingness to begrudgingly accept genetically modified foods is that the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) performs no tests on such products. As Jason Dietz, a policy analyst at FDA, explained: “It’s the manufacturer’s responsibility to insure that the product is safe.” However, companies like Monsanto are under no obligation to test their products for safety considerations; the process is completely voluntary.  “Well, the companies are supposed to do a voluntary consultation,” Michael Hansen, a critic of GM foods at the Consumers Union,\\xa0told Grist. “[B]ut it’s voluntary. Look at what the FDA says when they approve a food: ‘It is our understanding that Monsanto has concluded this is safe.’ They just rubber-stamp it.” While Americans are being essentially used as laboratory test bunnies, paying good money to consume products that may or may not kill them, Putin refuses to play Russian roulette with his peoples’ health. In June, Putin\\xa0approved a bill that bans all genetically engineered foods from entering Russia. The legislation includes stiff fines for producing GMO products in Russia or importing them from abroad, with the exception of genetically altered organisms and materials used for expertise and research. Meanwhile, Americans will be happy to know that Russia is offering a healthy alternative to what the global food corporations are delivering. In his state of the nation speech on December 3 in the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin said, “We can not only feed ourselves, Russia can become an important global supplier of healthy, organic and high-quality food, especially since the global demand for such products is showing a steady growth.” Since many Westerners will never have an opportunity to visit Russia, their perceptions of this relatively distant country are largely shaped for them by journalists, the majority of whom are predisposed to a form of self-imposed censorship that is constantly whispering in their ear that Russia must never appear attractive to their readers, lest they want to lose their jobs. Thus, whenever news travels from Russia across the ocean to Western audiences, it is inevitably tainted by misconceptions, misinformation and outright lies. A classic example of this is the Western media outcry following Putin’s so-called ‘anti-gay’ legislation, which is in fact ‘pro-children’ legislation. Putin patiently\\xa0explained the legislation in an interview with World Media: \"[…] All people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Everybody is equal. We have recently only passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality only, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. But this has nothing in common with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation. And there is a world of difference between these things.\" Personally - and I’ve spoken with many people on this issue who feel the same way - this passage sounds like the Mount Everest of common sense. Why on earth should children be exposed to issues – whether they are of a homosexual, heterosexual, metrosexual or what-have-you-sexual content – at such an early age? There is an appropriate time for such considerations later in life and probably better after puberty. Well, good luck trying to convince the Western media of that. Harvey Fierstein, just prior to the Sochi Olympics, wrote in the New York Times that \"Putin has declared war on homosexuals... allowing police officers to arrest tourists and foreign nationals they suspect of being homosexual, lesbian or “pro-gay” and detain them for up to 14 days.\" Fierstein, an actor and playwright, not a lawyer, continued\\xa0peddling absurdities that \"the law could mean that any Olympic athlete, trainer, reporter, family member or fan who is gay — or suspected of being gay, or just accused of being gay — can go to jail.\" To be honest, this ranks as some of the smelliest anti-Russia rubbish I have ever read (If I may, I would just like to assure readers, and especially the homosexuals, there are no anti-gay goon squads on patrol in Russia, so feel free to pack your rainbow-colored T-shirt). Instead of quoting a Russian source (this may come as a surprise, but Russia does have lawyers) that might just have some insight as to what the law really says, Fierstein\\xa0quoted the Huffington Post, who got their blotched information from an obscure Canadian travel site. So much for investigative journalism. In any case, Putin’s actions on behalf of protecting children (not arresting homosexuals) offer a nice counterbalance to America’s disturbing desire to expose children to overt sexual messages at very young ages. And not just your traditional fireside chats with Dad about the birds and the bees. No, that would be too damm sensible. Today, many American schoolchildren, before they are old enough to lace up their shoes, are being psychologically strip searched, with demands being made upon them to come to terms with their sexuality, with forays into the tall weeds of transgender. Personally, I am grateful for Putin to present an alternative method for addressing such extremely sensitive issues to our children. Although the US continues to enforce a sanctions regime against Russia, which seems, incidentally, to be damaging Western interests far more than Russia’s, Putin continues to let America use Russian rockets to travel to outer space, keeping the US from being a landlocked superpower. Needless to say, this is a rather embarrassing situation for NASA, which must rely on the Atlas V rocket, powered by a Russian rocket engine, to transport its satellite technology into the cosmos.Senator John McCain, a perennial anti-Russia bugbear, recently stormed: “Today, Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground.\" Former NASA administrator Mike Griffin put the problem squarely on Washington’s shoulders, complaining that “Americans spend more annually on pizza ($27 billion USD) than on space.” “Due to such changes NASA’s mission today is much weaker than several decades ago,”wrote Nenad Drca in Modern Diplomacy. “The United States, first to send men to the moon in 1969, now struggles in the 21st century to reach beyond low-earth orbit without expensive Russian assistance. How the mighty have fallen…” All things considered, the United States – and the world - has far more to gain with better relations, not just with Vladimir Putin, but with Russia.

According to official estimates, Russian inflation in 2015 should have hit 12.2 percent.

In particular, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov predicted even higher inflation this year; slightly more than 13 percent. However, he predicted that inflation will slow down in Russia next year. \"We plan inflation will be at the level of 6-7 percent compared to a little more than 13 percent in the current year,\" he said.

First step: 48h #Syriaceasefire, coordinated airstrikes \\'provided there is a sustained period of reduced violence\\'  https://t.co/1MeCyNAvE5 “After the ceasefire regime will be in effect for seven days, we will establish an implementation centre, in which the military and the representatives of Russian and US intelligence will handle practical issues, separating terrorists and opposition,” he added. The Russian FM said that the diplomats have negotiated on five separate documents at the talks. “Despite the mistrust and attempt to disrupt what we have agreed upon, we managed to work out a package of documents, there are five of them. It allows us to set an effective coordination in the fight against terrorism, to expand the humanitarian access to distressed population, first and foremost in Aleppo,” Lavrov said. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained in the agreements, they will not be made available to general public, Lavrov said. “We cannot make these documents public. They contain rather serious, sensitive information. We don’t want it to fall into hands of those who would surely try to disrupt the implementation of the measures stipulated within the framework of humanitarian delivery supplies and in other parts of our agreements.” To succeed all opposition groups must be included in negotiations - #Lavrovhttps://t.co/1MeCyNAvE5#Syriapic.twitter.com/jEEmPFnzyF According to the agreement, both Syrian government and opposition forces will “be required to provide safe, unhindered and sustainable humanitarian, commercial and civilian access to eastern and western Aleppo,” Kerry said. Rebels are actively preventing the safe passage of humanitarian aid to civilians in Aleppo, Lavrov said, adding that opposition groups stationed there are threatening to attack Russian humanitarian convoys. \"The convoy was ready to go on August 26. But the opposition said that any convoy going down the Castello highway will be shelled,\" he said. On Friday, seven people, mostly women and children, were killed and at least 24 injured in a terrorist attack on northern Aleppo after militants fired a missile in the area, according to Syria’s state SANA news agency. Lavrov emphasized the importance of all opposition groups being included in the negotiations for the reconciliation process to succeed.“It is the demand of the UN Security Council. Resolution 2254 proclaims that the negotiations should be inclusive, with participation of all Syrian parties, including the groups that have been formed in Moscow, Cairo, El-Riyadh and other places,” he said. The minister added that there were provocations by some unspecified countries that aimed to portray one of the groups as the only legitimate representative of Syrian opposition at the talks. Meanwhile, political analyst Ammar Waqqaf has cast doubt on the sincerity of Kerry’s assertion that “going on Al-Nusra” was never a negotiating point. “United States have made a big decision in ditching Jabhat Al-Nusra to preserve the other fighting groups, the other what they call the moderate fighting groups,” the analyst told RT, calling it the “cornerstone” of the deal. Waqqaf is sure that Washington’s move was prompted by the rapid advance of Syrian armed forces on rebel positions, which would have imminently led to the “severe deterioration” of the so-called moderate forces and hardline terrorist groups, including Al-Nusra, alike. The decision to turn away from the most radical groups was made “to try and tie the Syrian state hand and Russian hand, in order to preserve the other groups who are less extremist but still extremist but they would call them moderate know,” to preserve less extremist rebels.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 The recent Al-Nusra rebranding when the militant group formally severed all ties with Al-Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham could have resulted in its inclusion into the moderate opposition if Washington had not strived to find a compromise with Russia, Waqqaf said. For its part, the Saudi-backed High Negotiating Committee (HNC) issued a statement welcoming the split and encouraging the former Al-Nusra group to commit to further reforms. “Saudi Arabia saw an opportunity to bring Jabhat Al-Nusra, which is a formidable fighting force under their umbrella, and tried to tell the Americans: Look, we can turn this into real moderates and you do not have to bomb them.”\\xa0  However, “Americans knew that there would be no deal with Russian unless Jabhat Al-Nusra is called Jabhat Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda and that they are separate [from moderate rebels].” '],\n",

              "  'Speaking to RT Zakharova said that after receiving an “official ban from State Department” for Russian diplomats to monitor US elections, American officials essentially moved to ‘threats.’ The latest happened just over the weekend, according to the official. “Indeed in several cases intimidation measures were applied to the Russian diplomats, in particular, to our diplomat in Houston. His car was stopped, the road blocked and then [FBI] started to talk to him in an aggressive way, asking why Russian diplomats are generally interested in [US] elections. Despite in this particular case there was no ground for such a conversation,” Zakharova said. Earlier the official published a message\\xa0on her Facebook page, saying Washington applied “direct pressure” on Russian facilities on US soil involving the FBI and other security services.\\xa0 American “special services conducted several attempts of such threatening,” warning Russian diplomats “not to even think about getting interested in the elections,” Zakharova told RT. In return Moscow has already filed “a respective note to the State Department.” In late October, the Russian embassy in Washington released a statement, saying US officials had threatened its staff with criminal prosecution if they attempted to monitor presidential and congressional elections at polling stations. The embassy however insisted it has merely voiced an intent to do so and that “it has not submitted any requests” to US authorities. “What is that what the US authorities are hiding and trying to hide at the polling stations, that they do not allow foreign diplomats to even come close to the polls,” Zakharova asked. The official also noted that “surprisingly” Moscow has been among “top issues which the [US] candidates focused on,” while the American public should think of actual problems inside the country like “politics economy, health system.” Relations between Moscow and Washington have been particularly strained in the past month over the alleged Russian hacking attacks against US officials and facilities as well as over the Syrian deadlock. When asked whether the mood in Washington might change after the elections Zakharova stressed that “anti-Russian rhetoric is absolutely a way in nowhere, it is a dead end.” Lots of what is happening on the international arena “depends on the cooperation between our countries,” the spokeswoman said, noting that “numerous international crises and their solutions proved that.” Close cooperation between Moscow and Washington alongside other international partners lead to a historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear program in 2015 after years of negotiations with Tehran. “The more stable a dialogue between Moscow and Washington will be, the more stable will be international relations,” Zakharova concluded.

But the most important is to increase the prevention of conflicts…Now more that 65 million people are displaced by conflict in the world. And we see this multiplication of new conflicts; we see old conflicts that never die. It is absolutely essential to increase the resources, the capacities, the possibility to mobilize all those that have an influence on the parties to the conflicts in order to prevent those conflict from happening, and then in order to solve them as soon as they happen. This is the biggest flow we have today in the international community capacity. And it is this flow that needs to be addressed with maximum priority, because better than to help refugees is to make sure that there won’t be more refugees in the future. RT: What will your priority be if you’re elected UN secretary-general? AG: I think that we need a surge in the diplomacy for peace. The UN has the role to play as an honest broker, as a convener in a humble way, but helping countries to come together – those that have an influence on different parties to different conflicts to come together to understand that now these are wars in which nobody is winning, everybody is losing. That became a nightmare not only for the countries involved in the war, but for the whole international community.\\xa0\\xa0 We see the connection between global terrorism and conflict. We see attacks in Beirut, in Paris, in Orlando, everywhere… We saw the tragic event with the Russian plane coming from Egypt. So this is something in which now there is a fundamental interest of everybody in the world to come together and to put an end to these conflicts. I see the UN can play a role in helping people come together and doing some discreet diplomacy, facilitating trust being built for the international community to be able to act as a whole and to make sure that we avoid this terrible multiplication of conflicts that we’re witnessing today. RT: The UN has been dealing with global peace and stability for 65 years. With terrorism, the refugee crisis and climate change, is the organization still up to its mission? AG: Obviously. There is still a long way to go. Many people in different UN organizations are doing their best. We see UN agencies delivering humanitarian aid; we see the mobilization of the international community [in response] to climate change in the Paris agreement; we see the new Agenda 2030 in relation to sustainable development. There is progress in many areas. But let’s be clear, there is still a long way to go to create the conditions of trust for all member states to be engaged in the most important objective of them all, which is to establish peace and security in our troubled world. RT: Ban Ki-moon recently said Russia has a very important role to play, and that he counts heavily on its leadership. What's your view on that, as Russia's hasn't been a favorite in the West since the Ukrainian crisis erupted more than two years ago? AG: Well, I do believe that Russia is an absolutely fundamental partner in all international efforts to bring more peace and stability to the world. The coordination, the cooperation between the UN and Russia and creating the conditions to increase also the trust in the relations between Russia and other powers in the world is absolutely crucial. There is no way we can address the problems of today’s world without the strong involvement of Russia. Russia’s role is absolutely essential, absolutely crucial in creating the conditions for us to be able to move forward in all key aspects of international agenda. RT: The EU has reportedly agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia for another six months. But we've heard from many politicians that it's now time to build bridges, not walls. What's your view? AG: We need to increase dialogue between all key players in the international community. Russia is one of these key players; the EU is one of the key players. The US is another key player. There must be better dialogue, better cooperation, better understanding – that is the way forward. RT: When it comes to solving the Syrian crisis, Moscow and Washington seem to agree on many things, but sparks often fly high between their envoys at the Security Council and they often don't see eye to eye. Can they find a new way or working, or are there deep-seated differences that just can't be overcome? AG: I’ve seen Moscow and Washington come together very closely. The two are playing a very important role in creating the conditions for peace to be established in Syria. I believe that effort needs to be enlarged to other countries. Regional powers have today a very important role in the questions of peace and security. It is important to put on board also countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. I believe that Russia and the US are moving in the right direction, but they need to bring onboard other key partners in order to make sure that the comprehensive solution is possible… RT: There has been a refugee deal signed between the EU and Turkey, which key aspect was to solve refugee crisis in Europe. Do you think it works properly? AG: I am not following the deal and its evolution very closely… But the most dramatic scene for me is that the problems are not solved. The central problem is the Syrians that are suffering so much. Seeing the houses bombed, seeing the members of the families being killed, their communities being destroyed. The Syrians are now starting not to have a place to escape, starting not to have international protection evaluable for them in Europe and in the neighborhood. This is something that needs to be corrected. That is why I have been advocating since last year and the UNHCR is advocating today for a massive resettlement program allowing Syrians to be able to restart their lives in different parts of the world with a common international effort to give an adequate answer to this immense tragedy of Syrian people.

              "  'Late on Saturday night, the suicide bomber drove the vehicle into a busy shopping intersection in the affluent Karrada district of the Iraqi capital. The holy month of Ramadan meant the street was busy with residents breaking their fast after nightfall, with many also gathered to watch the Euro 2016 football championship on public\\xa0TV screens, and shop ahead of next week’s Eid festival. Then the explosion rang out. \"It was like an earthquake. I wrapped up my goods and was heading home when I saw a fireball with a thunderous bombing,\" eyewitness Karim Sami told AP. \"I was so scared to go back and started to make phone calls to my friends, but none answered.\" A host of buildings – including a shopping center and a gym – were damaged, with charred cars smoking in the street. At least 25 children were killed, and the death toll mounted throughout Sunday, as a fire took 12 hours to contain, and rescue services attempted to extract bodies from under the rubble. Almost immediately, the Islamic State terror group boasted that it was behind the attack on its sectarian rivals, calling it a “security operation.” In another Baghdad district, a roadside bomb exploded in a busy market, killing five and injuring 16, in a consistent pattern with Islamic State’s favored tactic of launching multiple near-simultaneous attacks to create a sense of terror. No one has yet claimed responsibility for that attack, however. READ MORE: ‘US uses sectarian violence as weapon to unthread and destabilize Middle East’ One person has been arrested in connection with the explosions. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a politician from Iraq’s Shia community, raced to Karrada, vowing revenge. \"The terrorist groups carried out such desperate deadly attacks as a result of being crushed in the battlefield,\" said al-Abadi, in reference to the government’s recapture of Fallujah from ISIS over the past month. But few were contented with al-Abadi’s rhetoric, and videos uploaded on the internet showed his cortege being jeered by Karrada residents, with many throwing cans and stones at the armored vehicles. According to Iraq Body Count, more than 1,000 civilians have died violently each month this year, continuing a resurgence in violence in the country, which has been concurrent with the rise of Islamic State. #Iraq: Kubiš Condemns Cowardly #Baghdad Bombing: Despite Pain and Agony, Iraqis Will Triumph Over Terrorism #Karaddapic.twitter.com/LFMFwB6eYl We strongly condemn yday’s cowardly attack in #Karrada#Baghdad.

They will not succeed,” said a statement from the White House, which has endorsed and supported the latest counter-offensive against the Islamists.

              "  'According to Rakhmanov, USC will continue to construct vessels and various marine engineering for the oil and gas industries. Established in 2007, USC is the largest shipbuilding company in Russia. The state-owned firm unites shipyards, design offices and ship repair facilities, accounting for 80 percent of the domestic shipbuilding industry. Since Turkey and Egypt became off-limits for Russian tourists, there has been an approximately 800 percent hike in bookings for cruise liners inside the country, according to business daily Kommersant. The most popular destinations are river cruises from Moscow to St. Petersburg and Kazan. Many tourists who chose holiday cruises used to vacation in Europe. But after the ruble depreciated, they simply cannot afford it anymore. The Soviet Union had a fleet of ocean liners that made cruises on the Black and Baltic Seas. These ships were mostly built in East Germany, Finland and Yugoslavia. The vast majority of these vessels, operated in the Soviet era, have now been written off for scrap. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia had troubles with local shipbuilding, as many technologies were lost in the 1990s. According to Rakhmanov, USC is now trying to catch up with something that hasn’t been done in the last 20 to 25 years. One of the main problems of Russian military shipbuilding is the production of engines. Before the deterioration of Moscow’s relationship with Kiev, Russia imported engines from Ukraine. The problem of supplying engines became acute after Kiev decided to sever military-technical cooperation with Moscow. In 2015, the Industry and Trade Ministry promised to substitute Ukrainian engines in 2017 or 2018. '],\n",

              "  '“The cause of death is two, penetrating, indeterminate range gunshot wounds to the back and abdomen,” Keith Lamont Scott’s family’s autopsy report read, according to the Washington Post. The forensic pathologist, Kim Collins, who conducted the autopsy ruled that the manner of Scott’s death was “homicide.” Scott’s family had to resort to private forensics examination after the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) refused to provide their autopsy and toxicology analysis to either the family or the press. “It’s a little frustrating, in this age when we keep talking about transparency,” Charles Monnett, one of the attorneys representing the Scott family, said, as cited by the Post. #Charlotte protesters march on highway on 4th night of demonstrations https://t.co/tIr0rBZAab The police have so far released a statement as well as bodycam and dashcam footage from the September 22 fatal shooting of Scott, following protests and riots in Charlotte. According to the police account, two plainclothes officers were taking part in an unrelated operation when they saw Scott pull up next to them. The two said they saw him rolling a marijuana joint. Then, one of the officers noticed that Scott held “a gun up.” This prompted the officers to leave the area, change into police uniform, and then “take enforcement action for public safety concerns.” At the same time, Scott’s family insists he had not been armed at the time that he was confronted by the two officers. Dashcam footage showed Scott, a father of seven, coming out of his car and walking backwards away from it until he is shot, but it was unclear from the footage whether Scott was holding a gun in his hand. “Was there a gun in his ankle holster? Was there a gun in his hand?” Monnett said, according to the Post. “It’s pretty clear that Keith never discharged a firearm and I think it’s pretty clear from the video that he never pointed any firearm at an officer.” Yet, the police said a gun was found at the scene, and they shared an image, saying it was the weapon Scott was holding.

It was muted for about 25 seconds, and no altercations or shots can be heard. Scott is only visible in several fuzzy frames, with the head of an officer covering most of the view. Afterwards, he is already lying on the ground, bleeding. The officer whose bullets killed Scott has been identified as Brentley Vinson. Days after the shooting, the Charlotte police chief, Kerr Putney, said that Officer Vinson was “absolutely not being charged by me at this point.”  '],\n",

The protest was organized by the civil movement “Stop Ramstein - No Drone War,” which says that the base, the principal US Air Force facility in Europe located close to the city of Kaiserslautern, is used to transmit information between the drones in the Middle East and their operators in the United States. The organizers also stated that using the German base for transmitting data for drone operations goes against the German Constitution and demanded that the base satellite relay station be closed. Some impressions of the protesters signs in front of #Ramstein Airbase pic.twitter.com/1w858TJQrW The protesters were holding placards and banners that read \"Most people want to live in peace,\" \"He who sows war, will reap refugees,\" “No NATO,” “Peace” and “We do not want to be accomplices in your wars.” They were also waving rainbow flags and bands. Former German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who also was the head of the German Social Democratic Party in the 1990s and a co-chairman of the Left Party in the 2000s, also joined the peace rally at the base.

In 2014, he disclosed that Ramstein Air Base was used by the US to wage highly controversial drone warfare in Africa, Yemen, and Pakistan. Data from the remote controlled drones is transmitted via satellite to Germany and then sent back to the US via fiber optic cable, Bryant said at that time, suggesting Ramstein is the nerve center behind the operations. 🔥People gathered to protest alleged #drone operations at #Ramstein#Germany#NATO , #US📸@GretaHamannpic.twitter.com/ffqDHkZd2K The United States has repeatedly denied that its German base, which houses over 600 personnel, is directly involved in the strikes.

Assad also noted that he sees no solution in sight, because the other side has powerful allies, and they are interfering in the situation in Syria. “If you ask me what the topics would be for a political solution, I don’t know,” he said. “No one has proposed anything.” “To talk about a political solution while the other side is controlled by masters in Saudi, Turkey, the UK, the USA, and France is not realistic. The core of the problem is those countries are interfering. If they stop, then the terrorists will be weak and leave or be defeated, and then we can sit as Syrians and talk about solutions,” the Syrian president added. Given the dire state of affairs, military support from Russia has been essential, Assad said. “What made the difference, of course, was firepower. They have firepower we don’t have,” he said, noting that, while other allies in the region have provided help, it has been far from enough. “We have some support from Hezbollah, but Lebanon is a country of only four million, so will be small. And some from the Iranians; but they didn’t send troops, they sent officers to help.” “At the end we were fighting an unlimited reserve of terrorists coming to Syria and we struggled, so Russian firepower and Iranian support has compensated,” he explained. For decades, Russia has proven to be a loyal and trustworthy ally to Syria that doesn’t put pressure on the country, Assad said. “Of course we make the decisions. The Russian military has been in Syria for six decades. Their policy rests on two things — morals and international law. Even if they have a point of view, they say: ‘This is your country, you know more.’ They never try to interfere because they don’t want anything from us. They don’t ask us to be a puppet president.” “They know if Syria loses the war against terrorism, this terrorism will prevail in Europe, and that affects Russia and everyone in the world,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 2 TV released on Saturday that Russia’s primary aim is to enhance its own security by preventing the jihadists from former Soviet republics that are fighting in Syria from returning to Russia and carrying out attacks there.

Venezuela condemned Rousseff’s impeachment saying it will not pursue relations with a government that stemmed from a “parliamentary coup d\\'etat.” Venezuela “has decided to definitively withdraw its ambassador in the Federal Republic of Brazil, and to freeze political and diplomatic relations with the government that emerged from this parliamentary coup,” the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

Brazilian democratic institutions have acted within its constitutional framework.” Meanwhile giving a speech before her supporters in capital Brasilia after the vote, Rousseff denounced the senators’ decision to remove her from her post and vowed to appeal her impeachment. “They decided to interrupt the mandate of a president who had committed no crime. They have convicted an innocent person and carried out a parliamentary coup,” she announced. “Right now I will not say goodbye to you. I am certain I can say, \\'See you soon!’” In response to Caracas recalling its envoy and the freezing of relations with Temer’s government, Brazil withdrew its ambassador to Venezuela. In light of harsh criticism regarding Rousseff’s impeachment Brazil also recalled its ambassadors to Bolivia and Ecuador, Reuters reported. WATCH MORE:  '],\n",

Iqbal told RT: “The police escorted us to the front of the plane. At this point the cabin crew had found someone…. and he turned around and said he heard the word ‘bomb.’ Later on he said we played a song with the word ‘bomb’ in it.” The men from Oldham, Manchester, argued that, while they might have been loud, they didn’t use the word “bomb” or sing “anything of the sort.” They also complained that Thomas Cook had no witnesses to back-up their accusations. “The biggest thing is, Thomas Cook can’t bring up one witness against us,” said Ahmed. “They have no proof against us. I don’t understand it. There were people on the flight who were louder than us. We’ve got witnesses saying that. There were people screaming and at the end of the flight we were the only taken off.” Indeed, fellow passenger Pamela Clark told the press: “I never heard anything about bombs. There was no bad behavior or anything like that from them.” The four were eventually allowed to continue with their four-day holiday, but the group found themselves banned from the airline when they arrived back at the airport for their return flight and were all forced to buy a new return flight with a different operator at £125 each. Thomas Cook airlines released a statement saying: “Four individuals were extremely disruptive throughout this flight and were refused carriage on the basis of their abusive behaviour. We do not tolerate such severely disruptive behaviour towards our crew or passengers.” When asked by RT whether they felt extra precautions on flights were justified due to the high risk of terror attacks, Iqbal said he didn’t “sympathize,” as no one but a crew member had come forward with complaints.

He said an alliance of countries was needed which could act in concert as “a feasible pole to counter the dictatorship imposed by the Americans together with their Western allies,” according to the minutes of the roundtable published on the Investigative Committee’s website. READ MORE: Top investigator seeks primacy of Russian law Bastrykin added that America’s current geopolitical dominance is based on its financial might, which in turn can be explained by “the uncontrolled and non-guaranteed” emission of dollars and the “all-enveloping” expansion of the currency. As that’s the case, Bastrykin believes the future coalition of nations should, as a primary measure, ensure the gradual removal of US dollars from their foreign currency reserves, followed by a total refusal to use the dollar as a reserve currency. “It is against common logic to financially support the country that is using these same resources against our interests,” he noted. The official told the audience that in his view the United States and its allies were waging a “hybrid war” against Russia which included price dumping on energy markets together with “currency wars” in the form of the uncontrolled expansion of the dollar. The alternative proposed by Bastrykin includes the integration of the financial systems of various member-nations of the future coalition, including international centers for the accumulation of investment resources and systems allowing cross-border payments in national currencies. He noted that several international organizations and groups – such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the BRICS groups and the Collective Security Treaty Organization – already contained the basic elements of the future alliance. READ MORE: Russia should ‘exclude international norms’ from its laws top investigator urges This is not the first time the head of the Investigative Committee has advocated greater independence and a more prominent international role for his country. In 2015 he proposed that Russia should legally enshrine the primacy of national law over international treaties. He also blamed Boris Yeltsin’s US advisers for including the principle of the superiority of international law over domestic legal procedures in Russian legislation. Bastrykin suggested the steps taken during Yeltsin’s time could be construed as legislative sabotage against Russia. “In this difficult period Russian society is consolidated like never before and most importantly society now understands that the time for constitutional reform is ripe. This is why I believe that gradually, step by step, these ideas will be implemented into life in the interests of our sovereignty and prosperity,” the official stated in an extensive interview with the Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily.

Our staff are not from another planet,” Younger said. “They are ordinary men and women operating in the face of complex moral, ethical and physical challenges, often in the most forbidding environments on Earth.” “In contrast to James Bond, MI6 officers are not for taking moral shortcuts. In fact, a strong ethical core is one of the first qualities we look for in our staff,” he added. Younger insisted that Bond’s erratic individualism would certainly have rendered him unable to “get through our recruitment process.” “Whilst we share his qualities of patriotism, energy and tenacity, an intelligence officer in the real MI6 has a high degree of emotional intelligence, values teamwork and always has respect for the law... unlike Mr. Bond,” Younger said. Some, however, would contest claims that MI6 is a bastion of ethical conduct, not least during the UK’s heavy involvement in kidnap and torture in the post-9/11 world. A Libyan kidnapped and delivered to the Libyan regime for torture recently questioned the commitment to morality of a previous MI6 head. In July, Abdul Hakim Belhaj said former MI6 chief Mark Allen was mistaken if he thinks a recent article he wrote for a Christian magazine means his “account is settled with God.” In 2004, Abdul Hakim Belhaj was kidnapped in Hong Kong with British complicity, along with his pregnant wife, and rendered back to his native Libya. He was then held and tortured by the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for six years. A note faxed from Allen to the Libyan authorities told the regime’s spy chief Moussa Koussa: “I congratulate you on the safe arrival of… the air cargo.” On August 4, a day before the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided it would not press charges against Allen, the ex-spook published a piece in the Catholic Herald on “Christian” approaches to terrorism. Belhaj’s response, which had been offered to the Herald, was published on the website of the Reprieve human rights charity. “His words on the power of faith to see us through bloodshed are too rich to swallow,” the torture victim wrote in reference to the now infamous ‘air cargo’ fax.

Given any two arbitrary hosts, it takes only 10 seconds to successfully infer whether they are communicating,” the team\\xa0wrote in a white paper. “If there is a connection, subsequently, it takes also only tens of seconds to infer the TCP sequence numbers used on the connection.

Even those using the much-vaunted anonymizing software Tor could have their privacy compromised 90 percent of the time in an average time of about 50 seconds. \"In general, we believe that a [denial-of-service or] DoS attack against Tor connections can have a devastating impact on both the availability of the service as a whole and the privacy guarantees that it can provide,\" the researchers said. The team notes that because only version 3.6 or later of the Linux kernel has the flaw, systems running older software are not affected. They distributed a patch to fix the vulnerability, but they note a large number of individuals and networks will still be left exposed to miscreants, since the exploit only requires one unpatched party for the attack to work.

              "  'The video release comes after former Shadow Business Secretary Angela Eagle said she would challenge Corbyn in a leadership contest if he did not stand down. Last week, Corbyn lost a vote of confidence in his leadership of the Labour Party by 172 votes to 40. The vote was non-binding, and he appears to be ignoring the outcome. More than 50 of the Labour shadow cabinet and frontbench MPs have resigned, triggered by complaints about Corbyn’s efforts in the EU referendum campaign. He has defied calls from outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron, former Labour leader Ed Miliband and deputy leader Tom Watson to stand down from his post. In his newly released video, Corbyn makes an appeal directly to Labour members, and says he wants them to “come together” to oppose the Tories and campaign for jobs, schools and hospitals. He says he was elected just nine months ago with the support of 60 percent of party members. “I have a huge responsibility, I’m carrying out that responsibility and I’m carrying on with that responsibility.” He says he has had a number of successes on the job, including forcing the Tories to rethink tax credits, police cuts, personal independence payments for people with disabilities and the forced ‘academization’ of schools. “When we do things together we are very strong. Now is the time to come together.” Corbyn said with 60,000 new members joining Labour last week, the party was the highest it had been in his lifetime. “That membership wants and expects all of us to work together in their interests.” There have been reports the beleaguered Labour leader wants to quit, but his allies on the left of the party are persuading him to remain in power. Corbyn’s aides are reportedly also refusing to allow him to hold a one-on-one meeting with Watson, claiming he may try to “bully” the leader into resigning. “We are not going to let that happen. He’s a 70-year-old [sic] man. We have a duty of care … This is not a one-off. There is a culture of bullying. Maybe it’s a Blairite/Brownite thing,” a senior Labour source told the Guardian. Speaking to the BBC, Eagle says it has been a week since Corbyn lost the vote of no confidence, and he is “not properly engaged” with the party or Watson. “There are many people, MPs, party members up and down the country asking me to resolve this impasse and I will if something isn’t done soon.” '],\n",

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  ' Green Party candidates Jill Stein, Kent Mesplay and Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza Curry are debating\\xa0issues such as foreign policy, electoral reform and domestic policy. We broadcast the debate in 360 on Youtube and on\\xa0our web-site. While the candidates are set to distinguish themselves in terms of strategy and policy goals, they agree that the two-party system doesn’t necessarily give Americans the representation that they are promised, especially with left-wing insurgent Bernie Sanders fighting an uphill battle against the Democratic Party’s nomination system. “It is all but illegal to participate in US politics outside the twin titanic business parties. A majority of US citizens are disgusted with the status quo and want something new,” Mesplay told RT. “By nurturing real discussion and debate, RT America reveals an insistent international movement of polite dissent: the Green Party. Such visibility emboldens would-be voters who want a viable ‘third party’ in the United States.” Jill Stein, who was the Green Party’s nominee in 2012, said in a statement that that added that the Green Party debate is good news for Americans who are looking for something beyond the duopoly that the Democratic and Republican parties hold. “RT is breaking the two-party stranglehold on debates and beginning the open discussion the American people are clamoring for,” she said. “It’s a step towards real democracy and an inspiration for the millions of Americans who are ready for a new politics that puts people, planet and peace over profit.\" Stein’s sentiments are supported by the data: More and more Americans are identifying as independents, and more are voting based on their dislike of a party, according Steven Webster, a political science PhD candidate at Emory University. “We see sort of two contradictory things going on right now. One is that people are increasingly identifying as political independents, and another is that people are increasingly voting straight-ticket,” Webster told RT America. “The nature of partisan identification is changing. It used to be the case that we had positive attachments to parties. So, ‘I’m a democrat because I like their policy positions,’ or ‘my parents were both Democrats’. That’s not the case anymore. What we’re seeing is that people are motivated by their feelings of negativity towards the opposing party.” The Green Party, the fourth-largest party in the United States, offers a policy platform that is solidly left-wing across the board that might appeal to disenfranchised supporters of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, should he not secure the nomination. A\\xa0McClatchy-Marist poll released early last month showed that 25 percent of Sanders backers would not support Clinton in the general election, compared to 69 percent who would. Many Sanders supporters claim that their candidate is running in a system that is rigged by party elites, a sentiment that the underdog Green Party couldn’t share more. “Unfair ballot-access rules designed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers to block alternative-party candidates; election coverage by news media that perpetuates the myth that voters have only two choices; exclusion from forums and debates, including the two-candidate charade hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD),” the party said in a statement.

              "  'The amount worked [among state employees] doesn\\'t even exceed an hour – and that\\'s based on studies, civil service minister Khaled Alaraj said during an official discussion of Saudi Arabia’s economy broadcast at prime time on Wednesday night. More than two-thirds of all Saudis in employment work for the government – compared to fewer than 20 percent for the US – and last year the kingdom spent about 45 percent of its budget, or $128 billion, to pay their wages. Prior to recent reforms, even a conscientious Saudi national civil servant had generous perks – a 35-hour working week, almost no prospect of being made redundant, and frequent bonuses, such as two monthly salaries paid to every bureaucrat, when King Salman ascended to the throne in early 2015. \"In my ministry we have more than a million job applicants. Of them, 200,000 are already working in the private sector and are prepared to take a pay cut,\" said Alaraj. With the economy expected to expand by only 1.2 percent this year, and oil prices hovering at around $50 per barrel, Saudi Arabia vast oil reserves, which still stand at over $500 billion, have been depleting at an alarming rate. \"If we didn\\'t take any reform measures, and if the global economy stays the same, then we\\'re doomed for bankruptcy in three to four years,\" said Mohamed Al Tuwaijri, the deputy economy minister, at the same meeting. The government has announced a raft of unprecedented steps to cut costs, some systematic, others haphazard. As well as introducing sales taxes for the first time, charging for pilgrimage visas at about $530 per entrant, dropping some energy subsides, and levying heavy new road fines, the government has been trying to slash costs in the public sector. Last month top officials had their salaries reduced by 20 percent, and their car and phone allowances sequestered, while ordinary workers lost 11 days’ pay when the government moved to the Gregorian calendar. Annual leave has been capped at 30 days. Underperforming civil servants can now be fired after three years, perhaps risible in most states, but a revolution in the kingdom, where many jobs are lifetime sinecures. In several departments throughout the Gulf kingdom, employees are now required to register their presence in the workplace several times a day, by swiping their ID cards. Yet King Salman is likely to proceed cautiously with any fundamental trims to the size of the public sector. For decades, the generous salaries paid by the state were seen as a form of redistribution of the oil wealth acquired by the country, which in turn paid for the loyalty of its subjects, who did not risk any calls for social or political reform. Throwing hundreds of thousands onto the streets is likely to endanger social stability, an outcome the House of Saud probably fears more than the depletion of currency reserves. To strike a compromise, officials have recently attempted to make the private sector more vibrant and attractive to employees, with reforms such as the end of the six-day working week, and reducing hours worked from 48 to 40 per week. In total, the government hopes that an extra 450,000 new jobs will be created in the private sector by 2020, boosting its size by a nearly one-third. '],\n",

Tension with Moscow is not the only thing bothering the military alliance. With a new US president soon to enter the White House, Western media is raising concerns over his plans for NATO. The European elites are growing increasingly worried about what any changes Trump may bring to the NATO alliance. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Stoltenberg urged NATO members to follow the British example and contribute two percent of GDP to the military alliance. Besides the UK, Poland, Estonia, Greece, and the United States are the only members of the 28-country alliance meeting the two percent threshold.

RT:\\xa0What do you make of Western media raising fears over Donald Trump’s plans for NATO? Jim Jatras: When the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact were out of business in 1991, NATO should have gone out of business as well. That didn’t happen. Unfortunately, NATO doesn’t have any particular function as a defensive organization - as we saw in Bosnia and Kosovo - it has behaved as an aggressive organization. It is an organization in search of a mission. Right now, we have Donald Trump who said that it is obsolete because it is not really defending its members’ territory against Islamic terrorism which is the only real threat Europe suffers. So frankly, what good is it? NATO is a product of the Cold War. It does not fit into our time anymore. My party and other parties; we can imagine a treaty which is for defense but not against Russia but more or less against another kind of threats, for example, terrorism…We should rearrange NATO and give NATO another structure and philosophy. In NATO there are still a lot of people in power who are attached to this old philosophy.-\\xa0Joachim Paul, from Alternative for Germany Party (AfD) RT:\\xa0Why are the European elites concerned about changes Trump may bring to the NATO alliance? JJ: It seems that there is still a very strong consensus for NATO in the American political establishment. Part of this is simply inertia that it is something that has been around forever. And let’s keep in mind: NATO is essentially a tool of Washington to maintain control over Europe in security affairs. Remember back in the 1990s, the EU indicated it wanted to develop its own defense capability, and that provoked near panic in Washington. The Washington establishment moved very quickly to quash any such independence from the Europeans and to insist that security affairs must be governed by NATO and only NATO as the premier security organization in Europe. The Europeans could help out if they wanted to, but they were not in control of the process.

JJ: If NATO actually breaks up, then we would see the assertion of more national interests based policy of its various member-states who will be promoting their own sovereign state interests and not basically subservient to a bunch of bureaucrats in Brussels and even more so in Washington. I think it is also very interesting to see what is happening to NATO’s twin – “Euro-Atlantic organization” – the EU, which is under threat of a break up with the British withdrawal, with the hopeful election of Marine Le Pen in France next year.

Is that true? Is it defending Europe? JJ: Defend themselves from whom? One of the criticisms that Donald Trump has made of European countries and NATO is that they don’t spend the two percent threshold on defense which he considers rightly to be free-loading on the US. Why don’t they spend that much? These are wealthy countries. They can spend that money if they want to. Even Greece, which is not in a very good position, is actually one of the countries that does spend more than the threshold because they do perceive the threat, but from Turkey, a fellow NATO member. The reason these countries don’t spend the money is because they don’t feel threatened. For all the hype of a so-called Russian threat, with the absence of maybe Poland and the Baltic States, nobody in Europe feels threatened by Russia or any other external threat. The only real threat they face is the threat of terrorism. And NATO doesn’t seem to know what to do about that.

              "  'In late July, a policeman found an apparently homeless man illegally sleeping in someone else’s parked van in the city of Volgograd. When the man, possessing a sheaf of blonde hair, was taken to the station and asked to provide ID, he said he had no documents, and that he was a gypsy by the name of Dmitry Mikhay. “Are you sure? Have you seen yourself in the mirror? Your complexion is way too light,” said the on-duty policeman, according to daily Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, whose journalist interviewed the officers dealing with the case. The detainee immediately confessed that it wasn’t his real name, and that he remembers only that he was called Vasily, when he was snatched by gypsies on his way home from an outdoor market where his mother was a trader. Police began to scan missing persons records. As well as a name, officers had another distinctive detail to work with – a large birthmark on Vasily’s chest. Soon, a likely candidate came up. Vasily Musofranov, a six-year old boy, “missing two bottom front teeth” and with a birthmark on his chest, who disappeared 16 years ago from the small town of Shakty, 350 km away. Musofranov’s case was opened as a murder investigation back in 2002, and remained unsolved. One look at the photograph was enough to convince police they were on the right path: the boy looked like a grown-up version of the child in a photograph that had been circulated in the media dozens of times in the past decade and a half. To obtain definitive evidence, the body of Musofanov’s father was exhumed, and a DNA sample taken, which produced a match. Within days a 48 year-old woman and a 46 year-old man from a nearby Romani settlement had been arrested. In a statement, police have said that the couple have “made a full admission of guilt.” According to the police, Vasily called his kidnappers “’mother’ and ‘father’, and his four new siblings ‘brother’ and sister.’” “I was scared at first, but then got used to it,” Vasily has told Komsomolskaya Pravda. Initially, his hair was dyed black to avoid suspicion, and he was never sent to school, meaning that he cannot read or write, or tell time. From the age of 16 he was forced to work to earn an income, which he gave to his “mother,” but last year he grew resentful, and decided to escape. From then on, he lived as a hobo, surviving by begging and doing odd jobs. Vasily has now been placed with a volunteer foster family, while his future is decided. But a happy ending is some way off. His closest surviving relative is aunt Elizaveta Bogomolova, who lives in Shakhty. She has said that his birth parents were problem drinkers, who were repeatedly fired from jobs, and were incapable of looking after their young son. His father, an Afghan war vet, died soon after the kidnapping, while the mother suffered a long decline, losing another child in infancy, before dying herself. Bogomolova says she is ready to help teach Vasily how to read and write, but is unsure if she can provide him with accommodation, as he prepares to return to life under his own name. His only other close relative is a half-sister, from his father’s first marriage, who emigrated to Finland even before Vasily disappeared. '],\n",

READ MORE: ‘Proxima b’ move-in ready? Closest ever Earth-like planet confirmed by scientists According to France’s CNRS research institute, the rocky extrasolar planet is in an orbit that allows it to have water on its surface, “thus raising the question of its habitability”. The international team of astrophysicists have determined that the dimensions and properties of its surface reveal a mass that is close to that of Earth, “which actually favor its habitability”. \\xa0 “It is likely to harbor liquid water at its surface and therefore to harbor life forms,” wrote CNRS. #Proxima b, une exoplanète recouverte d'eau ? https://t.co/0kNsywnMvn#LAMpic.twitter.com/UTyhK0ouDn However, it is impossible to know for sure what the planet looks like and what it’s composed of until it’s exact radius is determined. The researchers have two theories based on maximum and minimum estimations for Proxima b’s radius. In the first instance, they say the planet is either very dense, like Mercury, and surface water would not make up more than 0.05 percent of the planet’s total mass. \\xa0 Or, in the bigger scenario, Proxima b would consist of 50 percent rocks and 50 percent water, and the planet would be completely covered by a single layer of ocean 200 kilometers deep. “In these extreme cases, a thin gas atmosphere could cover the planet, as on Earth, making Proxima b potentially habitable,” says CNRS. Proxima b gained international attention when years of research into the planet showed it may have the right conditions to support life, all of which was published in the Nature journal last August. Proxima b, which is 1.3 times the size of Earth, was found to be the planet most likely to harbor life - and as it’s located ‘just’ four light years away, it offers tantalizing possibilities as a site for human relocation. Either way, the new discoveries lay the groundwork for further exploration and future studies to determine (once and for all) the planet’s habitability.  \"],\n",

The story in the report was completely made up, Zakharova said, dismissing the report published on June 29, in which the Washington Post claimed that a “Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) guard stationed outside the US Embassy in Moscow attacked and beat up a US diplomat who was trying to enter the compound.” The ministry’s spokeswoman explained that, in reality, it was a US citizen who attacked a Russian security guard stationed outside the US embassy when the officer tried to check his ID. “On the night of June 6, a taxi drove up to the US embassy in Moscow. A man with a hat drawn over his eyes jumped out of the car and rushed to the entrance. A police officer, who was on duty at the entrance, tried to check the ID of the suspicious man to ensure that there is no threat for the embassy,” Zakharova told journalists at a briefing on Thursday. “Instead of letting the officer see his ID, the man hit him with an elbow in the face than pushed him away and fled to the embassy,” she added, stressing that the Washington Post report “not only distorts the information but openly contradicts the facts.” She also emphasized that the attack on the police officer was recorded by the CCTV cameras and presented to the US State Department “long ago,” with Russian Foreign Ministry filing a protest over the incident. It was later revealed that the man who attacked the officer was in fact a CIA agent, who worked in Russia under diplomatic cover and was returning from a mission on the night of the attack, the spokeswoman stressed, adding that the agent apparently tried to escape recognition. She also said that information about the ‘diplomat’s’ allegedly broken shoulder reported by the Washington Post report is also false and was disproved by a video presented by the US side to the Russian ministry. Zakharova also emphasized that it is the US that asked Russia to provide security for its embassy and send police to guard it. “Moreover, they [the US] regularly ask us to enhance [the embassy’s] security,” she added. The ministry’s spokeswoman also expressed “regret” over “Washington deliberately souring the bilateral relations particularly by provocations and disinformation,” stressing that such policy “will not lead to anything good.” The Washington Post report came just a day after Russian Foreign Ministry slammed another article by the US newspaper that claimed that “Russia is harassing US diplomats all over Europe.” It’s the Russian diplomats who are being pressured, not the other way around, the Foreign Ministry said, blasting the article.

The bunker was built in 1966 when China was increasing its national defense, infrastructure and technology industries. It was designed to withstand thousands of tons of explosives and earthquakes. More than 60,000 soldiers were involved in its construction, at least 100 of whom died in the process, the Telegraph reports. It was built to create plutonium-239.

              "  'The decision was made by the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, Saudi state media reported. Those convicted were members of an “Iranian spy cell” which included at least 32 people: 30 Saudis, 1 Afghan and 1 Iranian. They were arrested in 2013. Two of them were acquitted, 15 were given prison sentences ranging from six months to 25 years, and 15 others were sentenced to death. Most of the convicts served in the military and diplomatic spheres. They also worked in economic, financial and academic fields. The men are accused of collaborating with agents from Iranian intelligence and leaking information on the Saudi armed forces and national security to Tehran. They also attempted to recruit people “working in state agencies to commit acts of espionage for the Iranian intelligence service.” Others hacked into computers to obtain the data concerning internal and external security of Saudi Arabia. Some of the suspects even allegedly met Iran’s Supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The majority of the convicts were members of the Shiite minority, a source close to the case told AFP.Some were also accused of supporting demonstrations in the Shiite-dominated Qatif governorate in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. According to Human Rights Watch’s (HRW) Middle East researcher Adam Coogle, the trial was “flawed from the beginning.” He told AFP that the alleged spies’ offences don’t look like recognizable crimes, including “supporting demonstrations,” trying to “spread the Shia confession,” and “harming the reputation of the kingdom.”“Criminal trials should not be merely legal ‘window-dressing’ where the verdict has been decided beforehand,” he said. At least 158 death sentences were carried out in Saudi Arabia in 2015, the third most executions for any country, after Iran and Pakistan, according to Amnesty International. In October this year, an AFP tally showed that the kingdom had executed at least 134 people. Saudi Arabia and Iran have strained diplomatic relations due to different approaches to Islam, leadership of the Islamic world and oil export policy. In January this year, Riyadh executed prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. Nimr was among 47 people either beheaded or shot by firing squad across Saudi Arabia in one day – the largest number of individuals executed in a single day since 1980. The execution prompted waves of protests in Iran. Angry demonstrators broke into the Saudi embassy in Tehran, ravaging its offices and throwing Molotov cocktails at the building. In response Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir accused Iran of creating “terrorist cells” inside the Sunni kingdom after cutting diplomatic ties with the predominantly-Shiite Islamic Republic.

A leaked version of the long-awaited report\\xa0was released on a NASA Spaceflight forum earlier this month, but the peer reviewed open source paper, entitled “Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum,” has now been published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Pull on #Pluto’s ‘icy heart’ shifted dwarf planet’s axis – studies https://t.co/p7HUZSXVyrpic.twitter.com/yeC3Fyu4YO Although the level of thrust was quite low, it has been revealed that the NASA Eagleworks lab was consistently able to generate 1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt of thrust in a vacuum. “Thrust data from forward, reverse, and null suggested that the system was consistently performing at 1.2 ± 0.1 mN∕kW, which was very close to the average impulsive performance measured in air,” the paper reads, adding “a number of error sources were considered and discussed.” The EMDrive is a time machine as well as a \"teleporter\" as well as a space warp drive. We will venture out. pic.twitter.com/GZmnJgzSXW The system apparently defies Newton’s third law, which holds that everything must have an equal and opposite reaction. Generating thrust momentum in one direction requires something to be expelled, such as a propellant or exhaust, but the EM Drive doesn’t do this. The paper doesn’t explain how this is possible, but suggests the “supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorized as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.” The team behind the paper were testing to see if the drive actually works, rather than striving to attain the greatest performance, meaning that the system can likely be made even more efficient.

The paper notes that more research is needed to determine exactly how EmDrive actually works, and whether it is really producing thrust, as it’s possible that thermal expansion may be affecting the results. The EmDrive is scheduled to be tested in space in the next few months. Should it work there, skeptics in the science community will have to figure out how the drive generates thrust without exhaust.

              "  'The leaders of Russia, India, China, South Africa and Brazil, as well as several guest countries, will meet at the summit to discuss the strengthening of strategic partnerships, cooperation on Russian and Chinese infrastructure projects, joint measures to fight global terrorism, drug dealing and corruption, and some of “the most important” issues facing the world today. A declaration outlining the joint position of the BRICS group on the Syrian crisis is expected to be signed during the summit. China has repeatedly backed Russia’s position on the situation in Syria, while India has previously expressed major interest in achieving stability in the Middle East. “China and Russia hold similar positions on the most important international and regional issues, including on Syria and Afghanistan,” China’s vice foreign minister Li Baodong said this week. “The sides, being permanent members of the UN Security Council, continue close cooperation on international and regional issues.” However Brazil, unlike China and India, may choose to take a neutral stance on the Syrian crisis, political scientist Aleksander Shatilov believes. “The West managed to rock BRICS with the coup in Brazil,” Shatilov told RT. “As a result, Brazil will have a neutral opinion on many problems. The BRICS approach to solving international conflicts could be among them.” The integration of the Eurasian Economic Union (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) in the so-called Silk Road Economic Belt project is among one of the main goals of the summit. While infrastructure projects of the New Silk Road are already underway in EEU states, experts note both the importance of such an ambitious project, as well as certain possible obstacles that could stand in its way. The summit may also mark a further expansion of EEU to the east, according to the Director of Eurasian Economic Union Institute Vladimir Lepehin. “Today EEU, tomorrow EEU and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a day after tomorrow – other countries of Eurasian economical area, which are not members of EEU and SCO,” said Lepehin. The creation of BRICS raised hopes that the end of the unipolar world is near, but this “dream” is still unfulfilled and the new summit is an important step for reaching that goal, believes political scientist Daniel Shaw from the City University of New York. “The dream of the BRICS nations and really of all oppressed countries in the world is still unrealized,” Shaw told RT. “Eighth years ago Russia, China, South Africa, India and Brazil came together to form the BRICS block as a counterweight to US hegemony, to unipolar world where the US dominated military and geopolitically as well as economically. Eight years later that’s an unfinished dream and an unfinished mission, hence why this meeting, this summit this weekend in India is all the more important.” The previous BRICS summit took place in the southern Ural city of Ufa, Russia, in July 2015. BRICS countries then established the New Development Bank (NDB), which has the potential to become an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). '],\n",

              "  \"Following the failed July 15 coup attempt that left 246 people dead, including many members of the security forces and civilians, cemeteries across the country are refusing to bury those who plotted against the government. In an attempt to remedy the situation, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayor Kadir Topbas said that he has ordered the allocation of space for the final resting place for “traitors” where “the passersby will curse the ones buried there.” “I ordered a space to be saved and [for it to be called] ... ‘the graveyard for traitors',” Topbas told a group of pro-government protesters in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. “Everyone visiting the place will curse them and they won’t be able to rest in their graves.” The decision to provide space, Topbas said, came after the mayor of Ordu, a port city on the Black Sea coast did not provide burial plots. As a result, the family of one of the dead took a body and buried it in their garden. “I congratulate the mayor,” Topbas said as quoted by Anadolu Agency, adding that coup plotters “won’t be saved from hell.” The mayor of Istanbul, a city of some 15 million people, also said that even the cemetery of the nameless was not a suitable place for the coup plotters to be buried with religious people. “I believe that they won’t be saved from hell. But we need make the world unbearable for them,” he told protesters. #Turkey’s main Muslim body prohibits religious funerals of #coup supporters https://t.co/DqUV78Jgjzpic.twitter.com/WwQPUinxIw Topbas’ speech came as the Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet) issued a statement, saying it would not offer religious funerary services, including funeral prayers, for coup participants, except those who had been “forcibly dragged” into the rebellion. The failed putsch left 246 people dead and another 1,500 others injured. In the wake of the coup, the government has started a witch-hunt against the organizers, as it blamed the Gulen-linked groups for masterminding the failed coup attempt. Turkey also requested that Washington extradite self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s president and his government of orchestrating the coup. On Wednesday, following a National Security Council meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a three month state of emergency and confirmed that the “cleansing” operation in the country would continue until all attempted coup plotters and supporters have been punished. Earlier, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that 7,543 people, including 100 police officers, 6,038 soldiers, 755 judges and prosecutors, and 650 civilians, have been detained so far. Since the coup, Erdogan has been pushing for the introduction of the death penalty in the country that was suspended over a decade ago. “The people on the streets have made that request,” Erdogan told CNN on Sunday. “The people have the opinion that these terrorists should be killed ... why should I keep them and feed them in prisons for years to come, that's what the people say.” Such move has been criticized by the European Union, which Turkey is trying to join. “Let me be very clear... no country can become an EU state if it introduces the death penalty,” EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said earlier. While Erdogan maintains that any decision to reinstate capital punishment would need to be initiated by the parliament, he has confirmed he would approve the legislature if one was proposed. \"],\n",

If they decline to make a decision, they receive the injection. The bill would allow the state to use the electric chair if lethal-injection drugs are unavailable. Drug manufacturers have protested the use of their drugs in executions, forcing many states to pass laws bringing back other methods, such as electrocutions and firing squads, which can be used when the drugs are difficult to obtain.

              "  'According to preliminary results, Eurosceptic and anti-immigration Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer was ahead in Austria’s presidential election with 51.9 percent of the vote. Then a late swing in the postal ballots gave victory to his rival, independent Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. Before the final results were counted, RT asked experts what a Hofer win could have meant for Austria and the EU. If Hofer won, it wouldn’t have an immediate political impact in Austria, because the president doesn’t really have political influence on day-to-day politics, says Dr. Heinz Gaertner from the Austrian Institute for International Affairs in Vienna. “There would not be an immediate political impact on the European level either. But it might change the atmosphere in Austria and also in Europe,” he told RT. He said the country is currently split into two camps: “the right-wing supporters of Hofer and liberal-democrats and liberal-conservatives who have a very different policy in mind.” Alexander Markovics, from the right-wing \"Generation Identity\" movement in Austria, argued that a Hofer’s victory would be very decisive for the Freedom Party. “It would be finally a possibility for the Freedom Party to redefine the position of the Austrian president which is actually very powerful, but its power was not used in the past,” he said. \\xa0 According to Heinz Gaertner, “the constitution gives the president a right to dissolve parliament and dismiss the government. But no president so far has used this right.” However, he does not think “a future president – even Hofer – would use it, or I would say, abuse it that way.” For the first time since the Second World War, the two main centrist parties were knocked out in the election\\'s first round. About half the voters support far-right views. \\xa0 “Many are just not satisfied with the coalition government we have had for many years; they just want to have a change,” Gaertner said, commenting on what could have caused voters to support Hofer. In his view though, it’s not really a right-wing shift what’s happening in Austria, but rather a divide - particularly on such issues as migrants and refugees.\\xa0 \\xa0 According to Alexander Markovics, the polarization within the Austrian society “is huge” and it has caused a shift of public opinion. “We have the socialists and conservatives who made the immigrant invasion in summer 2015 possible and who also let the security situation totally get out of hand. And now in Vienna we have ‘no-go’ areas where Austrians cannot go any longer, we have huge ethnic tensions because of the mass migration which escalated last year,” he said. “A lot of people are disoriented and totally disappointed with the political system in Austria because they don’t feel represented any longer since they could not participate in these decisions.” Friedrich Schneider, Economics Professor at the University of Linz, agrees the shift to the right was caused by the refugee crisis. Other causes, he believes, are “the euro crisis” and the “dissatisfaction with the European Union.” These three components, he said, “create a great uncertainty for a lot of Austrians.” “The future doesn’t look so positive anymore – we have rising unemployment. All this helps conservative parties which seem to have simple solutions to get votes…it is now up to the government to steer against this, to make policies which are credible and to take this vote into consideration for the next policy steps. …It is a clear signal for Austria that current politics have to make drastic changes,” Schneider said. Hofer’s age – he is only 45 years old, while his rival Alexander Van der Bellen is 72 – could have also given him additional points among the voters,\\xa0 said Arnold Kammel, director of the Austrian Institute for European Policy and Security in Vienna. “I think Mr. Hofer, being the younger candidate, had somewhat the advantage of giving the population a feeling that their concerns are taken seriously,” he told RT.

              "  \"In early December, secular and religious voices will gather in Dublin with the objective of highlighting the inordinate suffering of the Syrian people as a consequence of the unremitting chaos and conflict that has had the country in its grip for nearly six years, responsible for a horrific loss of innocent human life, the displacement of half the population, and a threat to the existence of minority communities that are able to trace their presence in the country back over a millennia and more. The dignitaries arriving as part of the Syrian delegation include Muslim and Christian clerics, such as His Beatitude Gregory III Laham, Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, the spiritual leader of the world’s Melkite Greek Catholic Chruch; His Holiness Ignatius Aphrem II of Antioch, world’s spiritual leader of the Syriac Orthodox Church; and they include His Grace Dr Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria. Meanwhile, secular voices among the delegation include Dr Ahmad al-Khaddour and Dr Bashir Mohammad. The former is a cardiothoracic surgeon and Professor of Medicine at Damascus University, while the latter is a cardiologist and native of Hama. Both are intent on raising the egregious role of EU sanctions in reducing conditions within Syrian hospitals to such a parlous state that women and children are dying every day due to the absence of basic medicines and drugs. In order to emphasize the authority that this delegation speaks on events in Syria, it is worth noting that each has witnessed, suffered, and/or lost family members and loved ones to a conflict which, strip away the obfuscation and claims to the contrary, involves an Islamic Khmer Rouge attempting to implement its very own Year Zero on a multi-religious, multicultural, and multi-tribal society. The man responsible for organizing this event and bringing together such an impressive delegation to visit Ireland is Dr. Declan Hayes, a tireless activist in support of human rights in Syria and a champion of its religious minorities. Declan, whose work can be found at the We Save Syria\\xa0website, has made numerous visits to the country over the course of the conflict, offering aid and solidarity to its embattled people and raising awareness of their plight back in Ireland and the UK. As a consequence there is no one who speaks with more authority on the reality of the conflict and the crisis that has engulfed the country than he does. “Though the visit is timed to coincide with the run up to Christmas and all that entails,” he said, “the situation in Syria, as East Aleppo's human shields show, remains very grave for all Syrians, from the youngest to the oldest. Although this visit is non-political it must be clearly stated that EU sanctions, in which Ireland are fully complicit, are killing more Syrian children than even ISIS.” He went on, “The USA, for all its Russophobia, has yet to deliver one bread roll or bandage to Aleppo, whereas the Russian Air Force continues to fly in tons of much needed food, clothing and medicines. Although Ireland cannot hope to match Russia's humanitarian contribution, we do have the chance and the duty to be a lodestar for peace and reconciliation in Western Europe by setting an example on Syria that other independent-minded peoples can emulate.” The Western narrative of the conflict in Syria would have us believe that something approximating to a revolution has been taking place in the country, one that enjoys popular support from ordinary Syrians. It is a narrative so grotesque, so Goebbelsian in its distortion of the truth, that it confirms the abiding mendacity of those who purport to champion democracy and human rights even as they set the world on fire. In truth the Assad government enjoys the support\\xa0of the overwhelming majority of Syrians, people who understand the difference between reform and ruin, and who refuse to stand by and allow their country to be destroyed by religious fanatics and butchers, supported by those friends of liberty the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments. Each of the aforementioned is of course a strong regional ally of Washington and its European partners, evidence that what passes for democracy in the West is in point of fact nothing more than organized hypocrisy.

Meanwhile GeoNet, the official source of geological hazard information for New Zealand, measured the latest quake at 6.3 and said its depth was around 35km.

The Ministry of Civil Defense immediately issued a warning saying that a “destructive tsunami” with waves of up to 5 meters (16 feet) was possible. The ministry treated the possibility of a tsunami as “an event of life-threatening or national significance.” Damaged road near Oaro State Highway 1 #eqnzThe road remains closed from Waipara to Picton at present.

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  ' The London Black Revolutionaries and the Malcolm X Movement forced the shutdown of the upmarket burger chain’s St. Giles and Holborn branches on Friday night by unleashing what they said were 8,000 crickets, 4,000 cockroaches, and 1,000 locusts in front of bemused customers. Protesters throw hundreds of cockroaches into branches of Byron over immigration raids https://t.co/W7saEXClDHpic.twitter.com/qWz1xEOx3H The Malcolm X Movement, which calls itself a “Black & Asian led anti-imperialist decolonial organization” on its Facebook page, has published a manifesto explaining why it decided to take “affirmative action.” In their post, they say that the chain has to “pay for their exploitative misdeeds,” saying they will “ensure it is shut down” until it goes bankrupt or compensates the deported staff and apologizes to them. They also declared that this is “a warning to other businesses,” which will also be “targeted.” “We’ve got a feeling Byrons [sic] will be closed for a few days on account of fumigation... This is just the beginning. Strike them were it hurts,” wrote the London Black Revolutionaries on their Facebook page, addressing their 11,000 followers. The Malcolm X Movement said that the stunt had wider significance “in the context of growing racist and even fascist oriented policies encouraging and fostering mass resentiment, [sic] racism and xenophobia towards ethnic and migrant communities.” In an operation that took place on July 4, but was not made public until this week, about 35 employees were called into a meeting, ostensibly to teach them a new method for cooking beef patties, according to eyewitness testimonies in the UK media. However, when staff arrived, the kitchen and floor workers, who were from Albania, Brazil, Nepal, and other non-EU states, were rounded up. Some of them have since been deported. Unconfirmed media reports claim that as many as 150 other employees went into hiding following the sting. UK authorities said the chain, which would have faced fines of up to £20,000 per employee for knowingly employing migrants without a legal permit, had been shown “counterfeit documents” when hiring them. Byron said it “co-operated fully and acted upon the Home Office’s requests throughout the course of the investigations leading to this action.” Despite being in compliance with existing UK immigration laws, the operation drew fury from a segment of social media and, by Friday, several of Byron’s London and Bristol outlets were being picketed by small groups of activists before the insect-releasing stunt was launched. The decision to use direct action to sabotage restaurant outlets has received mixed public reaction, with many pointing out it would be the staff that would have to round up the insects and lose income if a branch was forcibly shut for several days. Moreover, if the chain as a whole was forced into bankruptcy, as threatened by the activists, the employees would have to find new jobs. Utterly bizarre that people want hundreds of jobs to go in a way of supporting people working illegally. Politics is weird. #byronburgers Protests like this are just as bad as any other form of extremism, it has no place in our society https://t.co/hFejXifbaT Founded in 2007, the upmarket Byron Hamburgers chain has been rapidly expanding and now employs over 1,300 people at 56 branches. It first caught the media’s eye when former Chancellor George Osborne was pictured eating one of their takeaway offerings in his office in 2013. While the Home Office raid was not directly related to Brexit and intra-EU migration, the passionate public reaction comes against a backdrop of rising ethnic tension, which police say has resulted in 57 percent more complaints of xenophobia since the June vote.

Clinton aims at recruiting five million Americans between the ages of 18 and 30 to help local, state and federal governments cope with a range of problems, “from natural disasters in places like Baton Rouge or emergency relief in places like Flint, MI to addressing the epidemic of addiction in places like New Hampshire.” “The Reserve will provide a vehicle for the sense of civic ownership and responsibility that Clinton has felt throughout her life, bringing Americans from all backgrounds together in common cause to make a difference where they live,” the campaign said. In exchange for serving, the reservists would be eligible for college credit, time off from work, or even a “modest stipend” based on financial need, the announcement explained. Clinton said she would negotiate the benefits with colleges and corporations.

Whenever Hillary decides to. Millennials are eager to volunteer and serve, the campaign argued, citing as example that the number of applications to AmeriCorps is five times greater than the number of openings in the paid service organization. The former secretary of state also said she wanted to triple the size of AmeriCorps from 75,000 to 250,000 members and expand the Peace Corps. The expansion would also create new volunteer opportunities for Americans over 55, the campaign said. The Peace Corps was established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, as a way for Americans to “promote world peace and friendship” abroad. Its domestic version, AmeriCorps, was set up by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Though Clinton’s campaign floated plans to expand AmeriCorps in August of last year, the Democratic candidate is currently amid a major push to appeal to young voters. Polls show the demographic that decisively contributed to electing Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 is far less enthusiastic about Clinton.

              "  ' Before the visit, Putin published an article in Greece’s Kathimerini newspaper, where he spoke about the negative effect of mutual sanctions. “These days, Greece is Russia\\'s important partner in Europe. Unfortunately, the decline in relations between Russia and the European Union stands in the way of further strengthening our cooperation, with an adverse effect on the dynamics of bilateral trade that fell by a third to $2.75 billion as compared to last year. Particularly affected were Greek agricultural producers,” Putin said. In 2015 trade between the two countries fell by 33.7 percent to about $2.8 billion. Ninety percent of that loss was exports from Russia to Greece. Russian imports from Greece decreased by 54 percent and amounted to $229.4 million.

Over the past year the Greek leadership has criticized the EU\\'s anti-Russian sanctions, but has never used its right to veto their extension. According to some analysts, Athens is playing the Russian card to persuade Brussels and international lenders towards a softer position on its €320 billion debt. Experts have also said that historical ties with Greece could help Russia find an ally who could help to ease the sanctions. \"The extreme political and economic disruption Greece has experienced, in combination with existing cultural ties, make it a particularly attractive target for these kind of initiatives,\" Daragh McDowell, a principal analyst for Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, told\\xa0CNBC.

Seddique Mateen, farther of the Orlando nightclub shooter who claimed the lives of 49 people, was spotted on Monday sitting behind Hillary Clinton during a rally in Kissimmee, Florida.\\xa0 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reacted, arguing that there are double standards, because if it had been him standing in front of the mass murderer’s father, there would have been “a headline all over the world about Trump.”\\xa0 “But she did not, as I understand it, disavow this man. [Mateen]’s got some pretty harsh views,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. RT asked Rockwell and Welch if Mateen should have been invited to the rally and if his presence there could somehow affect Clinton’s campaign?\\xa0 RT: What’s your take on that?\\xa0 Lew Rockwell: First of all it is hilarious. Despite the Clinton’s campaign’s claim that this was just open to the public – nobody gets that close to a candidate through secret service and so forth, unless they are known. The people especially behind the candidate are always very carefully chosen for “diversity reasons,” etc. He said he was invited. Of course he was invited. This was a signal on the part of the Clinton campaign to the immigrant masses that they should all support her. But it quite wonderfully backfired. Some of us think if this guy hadn’t been brought to the US by the US government, and apparently he was, because of his Afghan connections, political connections; his hate for Pakistan, and so forth, all those people in Orlando would still be alive. The idea that this guy is… there is some kind of icon of the Clinton campaign. Well, it is really all you need to know about the Clinton campaign. \\xa0\\xa0 RT:\\xa0What kind of effect do you think it will have on Clinton’s campaign?\\xa0 LR: Who knows. If Trump is smart, and he is smart, he’ll make a big deal of it. But it is just a part of the rest of it. We learned today that Julian Assange is offering a $20,000 reward to investigate the death of this DNC murdered staffer. The implication being, and sort of a lot of people think he was the one who leaked the DNC e-mails. Was he killed for that? There is all kinds of bad stuff.\\xa0 I know the typical Americans seem to think that this sort of conduct only goes on in Montenegro, or whatever. It happens here too. The Clintons have got a long list of bodies in their wake. So the fact that they would promote this guy – Mr. Mateen – hold him up as a symbol to people that are interested in these sorts of links, blew up in their face. My guess is this was not Clinton’s personal decision. Although, you can’t really know – she is very, very much a detailed person, so we can’t rule that out. But somebody high in the campaign invited him in, brought him there, put him in that very prominent position, where he was in the frame of her during her speech – quite an amazing thing and sort of as a peek into the heart, if I can use that word of Hillary Clinton.\\xa0 RT: How do you think the media would have reacted if this had happened at a Trump rally?\\xa0 LR: I’ve never in my life seen media hate even for Barry Goldwater back in ancient days as for Trump. It is like the Two Minutes Hate out of George Orwell’s 1984 goes on every single day over and over again by the world media. It is the English media, for example, the Canadian media – all English language media, and probably foreign language media too hate Trump, hate Trump, hate Trump! There are many death threats against Trump – they never cover it.\\xa0 Facebook has fan pages advocating this assassination of Trump. It is not even an issue; nobody cares or they approve of it. Everything that Trump says, or allegedly says, of course, becomes an atomic bomb. On the other hand, there are a lot of people who think anybody this much hated by the media, this much hated by the establishment, can’t be all bad.\\xa0 Daniel Patrick Welch, a writer and political analyst, argues that Mateen’s invite to the event was just a PR gaffe.\\xa0 “It is a gaffe – nobody wants this kind of publicity,” he told RT. “He was invited along with three million of his closest friends. It is true. They could have, and should have, vetted this more clearly and they could have avoided a public relations gaffe. It is really a cover story for the failure of the American political system.”\\xa0 In Welch’s view, the whole thing “is a tempest in a teapot, or a red herring on a slow news day to take away from, or give the impression, that this is an actual vibrant democracy going on in the US, when nothing could be further from the truth.”\\xa0 “There is this political theatre, this joke, farce of a campaign. We have no choice at all – we have a choice between the neoliberal, neoconservative consensus and this right-wing populist, opportunist with open overture to fascism. And you expect people to make an informed choice between those alternatives,” he said.\\xa0 The analyst is confident that this ‘gaffe’ will have ‘zero’ impact on Clinton’s campaign.\\xa0\\xa0 “Everything that comes out that is negative about Clinton gets completely disappeared by the mainstream press. Trump will do something equally outrageous within the next 24 hour news cycle. So the attention will be drawn away from it – I don’t think it has any legs at all,” he said.

The Black Sparrow missile is air-launched from a plane, usually an F-15 fighter jet, before accelerating away to become a target for anti-missile systems to track and intercept. Surveillance of the missile, which has been used in tests of the Arrow and Magic Wand defense system, was a secondary task of Anarchist, and was code-named 'Runway’, according to the newspaper. It remains unclear how the NSA and GCHQ obtained the data, or whether it was taken directly from intercepted transmissions during Black Sparrow flights. Black Sparrow is produced by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, in cooperation with US defense firm Raytheon. It comes just three days after it was revealed\\xa0that the two agencies had been spying on Israel's air force operations for at least 18 years – information that was reportedly gleaned from documents made public by National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. Over the course of those years, the US and UK managed to crack the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) special encryption system for communication between fighter jets, drones and army bases. The two nations reportedly used that access to keep tabs on IDF operations in Gaza, watch for a possible Israeli strike on Iran, and monitor the drone technology that Israel exports.

              "  'Speaking to the national convention of the American Legion in Cincinnati, Ohio on Wednesday, Clinton wooed the veterans’ organization with promises of better medical care and a stronger military, while pointing out that her vision of an America as “the global force for freedom, justice and human dignity” enjoyed support of senior military officials and even the leading Republican security experts. “We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism,” Clinton argued. “We are the indispensable nation. People all over the world look to us and follow our lead.” “The decisions we make and the actions we take – even the actions we don’t take – affect millions, even billions of lives,” Clinton said. When America fails to lead, that either leads to chaos, or leaves a vacuum that other countries rush in to fill, she added. Clinton described the US as an “exceptional nation,” bringing up Abraham Lincoln’s description of “the last best hope of Earth” and Ronald Reagan’s line about “a shining city on a hill.” This belief in American exceptionalism should be above politics, Clinton told the American Legion, bringing up the recent letter by 50 Bush Administration officials criticizing the GOP nominee Donald Trump as reckless and dangerous. “They know I believe in a bipartisan foreign policy,” Clinton said, adding she was honored by their support. Hillary Clinton is giving a foreign policy speech right now that sounds like it was written by Genghis Khan. Reflecting this, the speech contained mixed messages about the US military, with Clinton proclaiming that the US “must always send troops in as a last resort, not a first choice… But we must be able to act decisively, alone if we need to.” The former is a strongly held belief of the Obama administration, the latter a key point of the George W. Bush presidency. Another example was Clinton’s condemnation of the cap on government spending that went into effect in 2013. Prominent Republican Senator John McCain has led the calls for getting rid of the sequestration and beefing up the military budget. \"The sequester makes our country less secure. Let’s end it,” Clinton told the Legion, adding that this would allow the Pentagon to invest in\\xa0new technologies that “can transform our military.” Clinton also argued the US must take the lead in outer space and cyberspace, citing\\xa0recent reports in US media accusing Russia and China of breaching a number of US private and government computer systems, including the Democratic National Committee and several state election boards. None of those claims have been substantiated by any evidence. Still, Clinton argued that the US should treat cyber-attacks like any other act of aggression, and respond accordingly. Hillary’s speech about American exceptionalism is now about mental health care for veterans. She then pivoted to the issue of veterans and their medical care, promising not to let anyone privatize the Veterans Administration and vowing to “build a 21st century VA that delivers world-class care” instead. This would improve care for overlooked female veterans, but also “identify and treat all wounds of war, visible and invisible, including Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome” and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as improve mental health services to “end the epidemic of veteran suicides.” Trump is expected to address Clinton’s criticism during his scheduled appearance at the Legion convention on Thursday.

              "  \"Oregon standoff: Are the Bundy brothers 'terrorists' or just ‘trivial’?\",\n",
              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'Social media has gone ballistic over the latest small-town American drama, claiming the mainstream media is going easy on the Bundys, not daring to slam them as \"terrorists\" because they are \"white and Christian.\" The debate began to rage after Oregon ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven were both sentenced to five years in prison after being charged with setting fire to US government-owned land in a part of the country where there are reportedly more heads of steer than humans. The conviction brought about 300 peaceful protesters out on the streets of Burns, a one-light town in northern Oregon (pop. 2,806), to voice their concern that the federal government should not be involving itself in matters the protesters say is a strictly local affair. The organizers of the\\xa0siege are brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, whose father, Cliven, grabbed headlines last year following a\\xa0tense standoff in Nevada against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over cattle grazing rights. The group has issued two demands that the government will be very hard-pressed to meet: to release the Hammonds and surrender control of the Malheur National Forest. “We’re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that’s been set upon them,” Ammon Bundy, the self-declared leader of the group, said in a Facebook video posted by Sarah Dee Spurlock on Saturday. A statement released by David Ward, sheriff of Harney County,\\xa0said the militants want to \"overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\" So is it true? Has the mainstream media gone soft on the Bundy gang, who are now holed up inside an isolated government-owned building, because they do not fit the popular stereotypical image of the traditional \"terrorist\" (Hint: has a dark complexion, does not profess the Christian faith, traditionally wears a heavy beard and seldom travels without foreign documents and explosives). Is America unwilling to come to grip with the fact that there is such a thing as a \"homegrown terrorist\"? ABC helped to fuel the\\xa0suspicion that the media was deliberately downplaying the situation when it released this anticlimactic update via Twitter: “Peaceful protest followed by Oregon wildlife refuge action.” And that was it. The reader could be forgiven for thinking they may have missed a Woodstock-style love-in on some private farmland. As predictably as thunder follows lightning, the tweet attracted a slew of sarcastic, snarky comments from Americans who were convinced this was an act of domestic terrorism, including this gem by Theresa Rose, who posted: “Here let me help you, ‘Armed white terrorist takeover (sic) take over wildlife refuge... you\\'re welcome.” @ABC Here let me help you, \"Armed white terrorist take over wildlife refuge\"... you\\'re welcome. Twitter user Willy Wonky fired off: \"That\\'s the most sugar coated headline I\\'ve ever seen... stop giving us white people headlines like that.\" Meanwhile, Donald G. Carder opined: \"There\\'s nothing ‘peaceful’ about a group of armed rednecks seizing public property. This is terrorism, plain and simple.\" @ABC that\\'s the most sugar coated headline I\\'ve ever seen...stop giving us white people headlines like that Finally, @AngryBlack Lady dismissed all decorum and discretion, asking: \"Are you f*cking serious with this headline?! RT @ABC: Peaceful protest followed by Oregon wildlife refuge action.\" And this leads us to the $64-million question: Should we categorize every act of public protest – even by some redneck \"armed militants\" – as an act of terrorism? The American Heritage Dictionary defines a terrorist as somebody who stages \"unexpected attacks on civilian targets, including embassies and airliners, with the aim of sowing fear and confusion.\" So are the Bundy brothers, whose only crime (so far) has been to seize a government office in the middle of nowhere, now bona-fide terrorists in the same major leagues as al-Qaeda and Islamic State? This is where we risk getting stuck in a swamp of semantics in an effort to establish exactly how to call such individuals. After all, just imagine if these white Christian \"militia members\" – apparently willing to wage a war with the government – had been a group of Muslims protesting the treatment of detainees in the Guantanamo Bay facility, for example. It is a safe bet to say the newspaper headlines would be screaming in bold-font print the world \"terrorist\" and perhaps even \"Islamic State\" from coast-to-coast. On the other hand, if we accept the idea that such acts of protest on the part of the people – which Henry David Thoreau elegantly defined as \"civil disobedience\" – are now acts of terrorism, then we must also accept the disturbing fact that the very founding of the United States, bloody and violent as it was, was based on \"acts of terrorism,\" thus making the entire American experiment in democratic rule null and void. #OregonUnderAttack:People slam lack of govt action after Bundy’s militia takeover in Oregon https://t.co/SMJB7K1hXMpic.twitter.com/BmbB1RAkqT Consider the Boston Tea Party of 1773, where a group of American colonists, fed up with paying taxes to the British crown, dumped a large shipment of tea into Boston harbor. This single act of protest, in which not a single person was killed or injured, set the stage for what came to be known as the American War of Independence and the Declaration of Independence. For better or worse, there would have been no US of A had those rebels at Boston not ruined the Queen\\'s tea shipment. Is there a single history book that labels these American colonists who went on to found the United States \"terrorists\"? Certainly not, at least not the history books stored in US libraries. Indeed, they are held up with great esteem as founding fathers of the country. This is not an attempt to justify the actions of the Bundy brothers, who have certainly committed a crime by their outrageous seizure of government-owned property (which, as a federal offense, could possibly carry a hefty jail term and fine). However, it is extremely important, I believe, to differentiate between full-blown acts of terrorism – where things go boom and scores of innocent people die – and acts of protest against a perceived injustice. Understanding this difference is crucial at a time when many Americans, instinctively suspicious of their political servants since the founding of the great nation, believe the US government has seized too many powers for itself under the very threat of \"terrorism.\" One need only consider the controversial passage of the so-called US Patriot Act (which few if any legislators had the luxury of reading), which places tremendous restraints on American freedoms and liberties. But I digress. The point is, we must be careful not to categorize every pubic dissenter as a cold-blooded \"terrorist,\" which not only does a great disservice to the English language; it instills the dangerous idea in the public mind that every act of protest is the equivalent to an act of terrorism, which is certainly not true. At the same time, for the US mainstream media to sugarcoat the actions of the Bundy brothers and their supporters as part of some \"peaceful protest\" is equally ludicrous, and especially more so considering how a group of Muslims would be treated under similar circumstances. The word that comes to mind is “hypocrisy,” which is perhaps the ugliest thing to witness in the media, considering that journalists like to imagine they provide a fair and balanced account of all events, regardless of the background of the actors. And as is so often the case in such instances, the truth regarding this dangerous standoff with the US government and how to label the Bundy brothers lies somewhere in the middle, and it is our duty – lest every act of protest by an American citizen be either downplayed as “trivial” or overblown as “terrorism” – to define our terms as appropriately and accordingly as possible. @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Lavrov stressed that, according to experts, \"in the foreseeable future it will be very difficult for EU countries to live without Russian energy resources.” An agreement to build the Turkish Stream pipeline was reached in December 2014. It was assumed the pipeline would replace South Stream that had been blocked by the EU. However, after the Turkish air force shot down a Russian jet last year, the project was suspended. Talks resumed after Ankara apologized to Moscow for the incident. In August, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish president said his country is interested in resuming talks on constructing the pipeline, including gas deliveries to Europe once it is in Turkey. In October, Russia and Turkey signed the deal on the pipeline that can handle up to 32 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Gazprom CEO Aleksey Miller said he expects the project will be completed by 2019. “For Turkey, this means another natural gas pipeline that will promote the country as a global energy hub. For Russia, the project is important because it will bypass the territory of Ukraine as a transit country, which has repeatedly proven itself as unreliable partner,” said economist Anna Glazova in an interview with Izvestia daily.

Moody’s analysts expect a material correction in asset prices, a house price downturn or a large decline in consumption put the UK’s economic growth at risk. “At the same time, the fall in sterling will mitigate some of the negative effect in the short-term by providing a boost to exports,” Moody’s says.

However, the RT crew still managed to film some flags flying above their positions. YPG are unequivocal about Turkey’s sponsorship of terrorist groups in Syria. Head of the YPG in Afrin, Abdu Ibrahim, says Turkey is definitely providing support for terrorist groups in the area. “Turkey wanted to make a coalition against terrorism, but any country which would be in a coalition against terrorism should not open its border to Al-Nusra Front,” he said. “When there is a Kurdish prisoner, when he is in Turkish hands, they deliver him to Al-Nusra Front, whereas a wounded man from Islamic State who is in a Turkish hospital: he gets immunity and guards. No one can even look at him. What more evidence do you want than that?” Abdu Ibrahim also said that some of the corpses that they found on the battlefield \"that belong to Al-Nusra Front were of Turkish origin and we even found IDs and passports. And the ammo we found in their warehouses - closed boxes of ammo - they were closed and stamped by the Turkish government. We even found clearance documents to allow [the boxes of ammo] cross the borders which proved that they were approved to cross the borders.\" Ankara says its direct strikes against the YPG are justified due to its links with the Turkish-based militant group the PKK, which Turkey has recently resumed its war against at home. The rebel fighters on the ground say they are certain Turkey is providing assistance to IS, Al-Qaeda and Al Nusra. “The reason Turkey is on the ground is to support groups like Al-Qaeda. Support for ISIS is coming from Turkey. They are shelling because it wants to occupy our land, not to help our people. Turkey dismissed many of the armed groups, and supported Al Nusra against us,”\\xa0Abu Jouma Benawii, a general in the FSA and co-founder of Jaish al-Thuwar (Army of Revolutionaries), told RT. “Our fronts against the regime have stopped, but our fronts against ISIS are going on and against Al Nusra as well. We are committed to the ceasefire, one million percent,” he added. Asked if he would have changed his mind about joining the uprising, Abu Jouma Benawii said in hindsight: \"Really I would have changed my mind, because everybody contributed to destroying Syria, at the beginning and the end it is only the people who lose.\" “Had we known that Syria’s friends would be like this, we wouldn’t have been with them. All our people were forced to flee,\" he added. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said Turkey has the right to carry out military operations not only in Syria, but in any other country hosting terror groups that threaten the Turkish state. He alleged that Ankara’s stance has “absolutely nothing to do with the sovereignty rights of the states that can’t take control of their territorial integrity.” “On the contrary, this has to do with the will Turkey shows to protect its sovereignty rights,” Erdogan added. houses shelled by Turkey in village near Afrin city pic.twitter.com/dY0yTjyQOv Turkish forces have been shelling YPG, which Ankara considers a terrorist organization,\\xa0as well as government army positions in Syria,\\xa0since mid-February.

Turkey’s “provocative” military buildup on the border and shelling of the Syrian territory could thwart the fragile truce and disrupt the peace process in the Arab Republic, the head of the Russian ceasefire monitoring center Lt. Gen. Sergey Kuralenko said this week. The ceasefire in Syria, which came into force on February 27, brokered by leading world powers, including the US and Russia, is designed to pave the way to reconciliation between the Syrian government and moderate rebel forces. They would together agree on a peaceful transition in the country. Some of the forces in Syria, including IS and Al-Nusra, are not subject to the ceasefire. Experts have been criticizing moderate rebel forces, but even they think that the situation is shifting now. Moderate rebels used to be “a fable, a pure lie,” Syrian political analyst Taleb Ibrahim told RT. “Everyone remembers what happened to the rebels who had been trained in Turkish camps by the CIA, and when they returned to Syria, and turned to Al-Nusra Front”. However, the situation is starting to change slowly, as more and more Syrian rebel fighters “discover that they are destroying their country and serving external plans to divide Syria.” Russian aircraft continue to carry out airstrikes against Al-Nusra front militants to “stabilize the situation” in the regions north of the city of Aleppo, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

Besides Poland, there are other bidders, but he refused to name them. The Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline is expected to provide an additional direct route for Russian natural gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea bypassing Ukraine. It will deliver up to 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year, doubling the supplies through the existing Nord Stream pipeline.

We suppose that everybody, who wants peace, should support this proposal,” Putin said. According to Putin, both Moscow and Ankara backed the proposal of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, regarding the removal of militants from Aleppo. “Together with the Turkish president we agreed to do everything to support de Mistura’s initiative on the withdrawal of military units, which refuse to lay down their arms, from Aleppo in order to end violence,” he said. The Russian president said that he and Erdogan had agreed to strengthen contact between the countries’ militaries and intelligence agencies. He added that Moscow is ready to develop large-scale military-technical cooperation with Ankara and the sides are now studying various projects. The Turkish military operation in Syria and ways to cooperate in providing aid to civilians in the city of Aleppo were discussed during the talks in Istanbul on Monday, Erdogan said. The Russian and Turkish militaries, as well as intelligence services and diplomats from the two countries, will continue to work together on the provision of humanitarian aid in Syria,\\xa0he added. “We thoroughly discussed the Syrian issue. We talked about the [Turkish] Euphrates Shield operation and evaluated ways we can cooperate in this direction. We specifically talked about what strategy we may choose in order to help, from a humanitarian point of view, the inhabitants who are in a dire situation, especially in Aleppo,” Erdogan said. “We have a common stance [with Turkey] regarding what must be done to deliver humanitarian aid to Aleppo. The issue is ensuring security for the deliveries of this cargo,” Putin\\xa0said. During the talks, the two leaders agreed to “speed up the work” on construction of such vital joint projects as the Turkish Stream gas pipeline and the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, the Turkish president said. Before the two leaders addressed the media, an intergovernmental agreement on the Turkish Stream pipeline was signed in their presence.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Johnson, who served as governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003, won the nomination for the Libertarian Party in the 2012 presidential election. He only acquired 1 percent of the popular vote, but that’s considered a big achievement for third-party candidates in the United States’ two-party system. In 2016, he is confident that he can shake up the Democrat-Republican dichotomy even further by offering ideas that distinguish him from both parties. “I am a classical liberal, which is being fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” he told RT. “The notion of, in this case, government spending, the government is too big, let’s get it under control, let’s balance the federal budget or there will be horrible consequences. And then personal liberty and freedom and the responsibility that goes along with that. So absolutely staunch supporters of civil liberties.” Johnson took both major parties to task for what he sees as a failure to offer pragmatic solutions to the American people. He criticized Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton for following in President Barack Obama’s footsteps by supporting government spending that will cause the national debt to reach $20 trillion by the time the next president takes office. “One, it looks like [Donald] Trump is going to be the [Republican] nominee, the other, it looks like it’s going to be Hillary,” he said. “Well is anything going to change under Hillary? And has Hillary not promised everything to everybody?” Johnson supports a balanced budget to decrease government spending, and suggested that, if elected president, he will do so through veto power. “As president of the United States I can veto spending, something I did as the governor of New Mexico, and that has a positive impact.” Though he was a Republican when he served as governor of New Mexico, he blasted Trump, the Republican frontrunner, for the celebrity businessman’s firm stance against immigration. “The first thing he’s going to do is deport 11 million illegal immigrants?” Johnson said. “That is absolutely ridiculous and building a fence across the border is too.” This kind of rhetoric, he said, will result in a large amount of “disenfranchised Republicans” and voters in general who will be looking for an alternative. While Johnson claims that he is not “delusional” about his chances of actually being sworn in as the commander-in-chief, the former governor is confident that he can help shift the conversation. “I could be providing that alternative, and I could bump up to a level in the polls where all of a sudden the libertarian view has to be addressed on every single issue of the day.” Businessmen like Trump and doctors like Ben Carson leading career politicians in the polls “is an indication of just how frustrated people are,” Johnson claimed. “Eighty percent of Americans want more than two choices, and yet they have no idea why there isn’t another choice.” One of the major stumbling blocks, though, is the unfair treatment of third parties by the Presidential Debate Commission, whom the Libertarian Party is suing after being barred access to presidential debates. “The Presidential Debate Commission, I think, is at the heart of why there aren’t any more choices. I think that the Democrats and Republicans collude with one another just another to just debate one another and I think the networks may play a role in that also,” Johnson said, noting that a Libertarian being included in the presidential debates would be a “game changer.” The Libertarian Party convention to nominate their presidential candidate is set for Memorial Day, and Johnson faces off against 25 others registered on the party’s ballot. “I think that I offer a pretty compelling argument to be the next Libertarian nominee,” he said. “But look, it’s a process and I respect the process, and I’m gonna engage it. And I hope everybody in the process has a fair shake. That’s the argument I’m making to the American people. A Libertarian candidate should have a fair shake in the general election.” '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'So, the unthinkable has happened. Donald Trump has won. And the so-called liberal world order, which has ruled almost unchallenged since the demise of the Soviet Union is probably toast. There’s been enough talk already about the repercussions for America itself. So, here we will stick to external affairs. But there’s one important domestic proposal which greatly affects America’s global position. In his victory speech, Trump made a major point of emphasizing his desire to invest heavily in America’s decaying infrastructure. And there’s only one feasible way to fund such a plan - sharply cut military spending and foreign aid.Thus, instead of flinging billions of American tax dollars around the Middle East, Asia and Europe, in what always amounted to bribing nations - or at least their elites - into friendship, Trump intends to bring a good deal of the money home. By any measure, this will amount to a geopolitical earthquake. Take Syria, for instance, where Washington has plowed huge resources into promoting a “regime change” operation against its internationally recognized government. A policy that has helped to destabilize yet another Arab country. In Trump’s view, rather than challenging the government of Bashar Assad, the United States “should be working with Damascus against the Islamic State.” If he maintains this position, it will reverse years of wrongheaded thinking from his predecessor, Barack Obama. And let’s not forget Ukraine, which continues to be embroiled in a semi-frozen civil war. The dogs on the street in Kiev know the Petro Poroshenko regime has postponed efforts at building a sustainable peace for one simple reason: the Chocolate King and his advisers were fully sure of a Clinton victory, thus giving them free rein to resume their assault on the breakaway eastern republics of Lugansk and Donbas. Now this dream may lie in tatters. Whereas Obama insisted upon a sanctions program against Russia for its re-absorption of Crimea, Trump has said he would consider recognizing Moscow’s de-facto control of the peninsula. “The people of Crimea, from what I\\'ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” he\\xa0said in July. So, Kiev’s only option now could be to implement Minsk. Yet, that requires legislation that Poroshenko feels he can’t push through his parliament -\\xa0such as granting semi-autonomy to the rebellious east and providing a pardon and amnesty to insurgents - which is jam-packed with radical nationalists. Furthermore, it’s telling that Trump\\xa0refused to meet Poroshenko in New York in September at the United Nations General Assembly. In fact, the president-elect didn’t even acknowledge Kiev’s invitation. However, Poroshenko did sit down with Clinton, which no longer amounts to a hill of beans. Then there’s the Baltics. These countries have received an extraordinary deal over the past decade or more. What Washington has effectively said is this: “We’ll pay for your security, so long as you let us use you to annoy the Russians.” What the NATO blanket has done for the Baltic elites is freed them from having to establish normal relations with Moscow and develop their own military; which of course requires both money and manpower in addition to political will and organization. Something they lack because they’ve failed to develop their economies to a sufficient level that the vast majority of their own youth would want to stay at home. Trump may\\xa0send them kicking and screaming into the real world. He’s suggested how the United States would not automatically defend NATO members unless they pay their own way. “You can’t forget the bills,” he\\xa0told the New York Times.\\xa0 “They have an obligation to make payments.” So far, only Estonia, the most relatively successful of three, shows any interest in doing that. And this brings us to Russia. Let’s be clear here. Short of an actual shooting war, Moscow-Washington relations couldn’t be much worse than they are right now. Both foreign policy establishments are distrustful of each other and it’s clear that Obama and President Putin simply don’t get along. So, Trump’s talk of smoothing matters is truly ground breaking, assuming he follows through on it, of course. On Wednesday morning, Putin said he looked forward to restoring normal bilateral relations with the United States. “We heard [Trump\\'s] campaign rhetoric while [he was] still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,” he said. “[I look forward to] building a constructive dialog between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other\\'s positions, [when it] meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” For his part, Trump has spoken of tearing up years of animosity toward Moscow in Washington and working more closely with the Kremlin. He\\'s also suggested the two countries could work together on fighting terror. He also\\xa0described NATO as \"obsolete\" and Putin\\xa0himself as a “leader.” Naturally, this was used against him in the campaign, where Hillary’s supporters, seemingly unable to fight him on policy, eventually resorted to a smear campaign which\\xa0labeled him a “Russian agent,”“Putin’s useful idiot”and a “Manchurian candidate.” There was even a\\xa0website called “Putin-Trump,” complete with a hammer and sickle illustration in case anyone missed the point of the slander exercise. This is all academic now because Trump has won. And the US establishment, and particularly the interventionist foreign policy bridge that did most to stoke up tension with Russia, has been dealt a crushing defeat. Nevertheless, there are caveats. Firstly, the US has a deeply ingrained “deep state” and they won’t suddenly transform into Russia-loving peaceniks at the flick of a switch. It\\'s also worth remembering how a Republican-controlled congress mightn\\'t always do exactly what he wants, despite the party ties. After all, America’s founding fathers deliberately made executive power hard to apply. And then there’s Trump\\'s own unpredictability. On the fringes of Sochi’s Valdai conference last week, Russian officials made it clear that they were concerned how he might not deliver on his promises. “At least with Hillary we get the devil we know,” was a feeling expressed so often that it became a theme. Despite these worries, Trump does offer one thing: the end of Washington insiders controlling the White House, for the first time since Ronald Reagan. In fact, the parallels with the latter are striking. He was also smeared by the establishment and derided as an idiot. But now Reagan is broadly regarded as a great statesman. Maybe one day we will be able to say the same of Trump.  The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Those three states bring the grand total to 13 and the District of Columbia. Altogether, 50 cases of Zika have been diagnosed in the US, all in people who had traveled to one of the 30 countries where the virus is active, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There was also one case of the virus being sexual transmitted in Dallas, Texas. In a new study published on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Ophthalmology, Brazilian researchers reported finding eye problems in 10 out of 29 newborns infected with the Zika virus, for which there is no vaccine or treatment. Retina atrophy, iris discoloration, and lens dislocations were counted among the birth defects, and in seven out of the 10 cases, both eyes were affected.

The first Zika outbreak was identified in Brazil in May of last year, and though it is primarily contracted via mosquito bites, it can also be spread through blood transfusions and unprotected sex, as well as to unborn children whose pregnant mothers are infected. The CDC advises men to use condoms or refrain from intercourse with pregnant women if they have traveled to a high risk country recently. It also recommends that pregnant women be tested two to 12 weeks after returning from afflicted regions. Four out of five people with Zika don’t experience any of its symptoms, which can include fever, rashes, joint pain, muscle pain, red eyes, and headaches – all of which can last up to a week. On Monday, the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center began operating at its top emergency activation level – Level 1. The last time Level 1 was enacted was during the Ebola crisis of 2014.

              "  \"Just days after news broke of Army National Guard soldiers being ordered to repay bonuses they received for enlisting or reenlisting in the armed forces – under threats of interest penalties and tax liens – lawmakers have begun making moves to help the troops. Both the Pentagon and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform have announced plans to address the issue. “We are going to look into and resolve it,” Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters on Tuesday, calling it “a significant issue.” The House committee officially opened an investigation on Monday and requested all documents associated with the California cases. Representatives also asked for senior National Guard Bureau official General Joseph L. Lengyel and Major-General David S. Baldwin to brief the Committee by November 17. “The Committee is seeking information about this serious matter, and to see that officials who mismanaged bonus programs are held accountable,” wrote committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) in a letter to Lengyel and Baldin. 'Outraged' Congress may intervene as National Guardsmen ordered to pay back bonuses  https://t.co/PurhLrMToxpic.twitter.com/4Rg8FMRsUx House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) has joined other members of Congress in demanding that the Pentagon cease collection efforts. “Congress has time... to protect service members from lifelong liability for DOD's mistakes,” Stars and Stripes quoted\\xa0Ryan as saying. The problem began over a decade ago, when recruiters offered soldiers up to $15,000 in bonuses for enlisting or extending their service, during a time when the government struggled to recruit troops for the unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2011, it was discovered that many of these bonuses was awarded fraudulently. Corruption and fraud within the management of the National Guard’s incentive programs caused the issue to fester unchecked. California has been the only state audited by the Pentagon so far, meaning that more veterans across the US run the risk of being ordered to repay a minimum of $10,000. To members of the California Army National Guard, the problem is hardly new. Major-General Matthew Beevers told\\xa0the Washington Post on Monday that Guard leaders have tried to resolve the issue before, including going to Congress and asking lawmakers to pass legislation two years ago. The bill was not well-received by the Congressional Budget Office, however, due to concerns that forgiving the debt would have increased spending. On Wednesday, Carter announced that he had ordered the DOD to suspend its efforts to collect the erroneous enlistment bonuses from the California troops, as well as steps to resolve the issue and to streamline procedures so that those who received the bonuses in error or through the criminal behavior of others can seek relief. “This suspension will continue until I am satisfied that our process is working effectively,” Carter said in a statement. He tasked a team led by Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine with creating the streamlined process by the beginning of 2017, with a goal of completing “the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible - and no later than July 1, 2017,” Carter said. \"],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"As Black Lives Matter demonstrations took place while the US Republic National Convention was underway RT spoke to Carl Dix, founding member of the Revolutionary Communist Party and Katie Hopkins, 'MailOnline' Columnist, to discuss police violence in the US. RT: During the Convention, there was a major Black Lives Matter demo and counter demo. You also took part in the gathering. What were your main impressions of the people who took part? Katie Hopkins: It got quite aggressive there yesterday in the square. The police were doing a fantastic job of trying to keep people separate from each other…. People are here to protest because they love to protest. There was someone I met dressed as a wall protesting about Trump. Somebody else is protesting about the fact that he wants to cull immigration. Someone else is protesting about the fact that he is Islamophobic. Everybody is here to protest about something. But what I came away with from Black Lives Matter is that really they have created the divide. Black Lives Matter has created a divide. Because they’ve said: “Black Lives Matter more”. Pick a side, which side are you on? I think that has really created hostility. That is why people are applauding the police in the streets because people are now on the side of the police. I think Black Lives Matter has done a really good thing for the police and for Donald Trump’s campaign, which is all about law and order. They are really working in his favor right now. \\xa0 RT: Trump has said the movement is dividing the nation and criticized alleged calls to honor the sniper who shot dead five Dallas police officers this month. Do you agree with the nominee? Carl Dix: Ms. Hopkins is talking like she knows nothing of the reality here in this country. Because the problem is that this country has said from day one that the lives of the Black people matter for nothing unless they can be exploited and savagely oppressed to build up the wealth of America - from slavery, from sharecropping, Jim Crow segregation and Lynch mob terror. And today, police terror, with the police replacing the lynching mobs, and lynching Black people and other oppressed people here. That is the problem. Black Lives Matter represents saying Black lives no longer can be treated as if they don’t matter. That’s what those people are saying. And I stand with them in many protests and demonstrations. But the other thing I say is that this violence of the police is actually them playing the role of front-line enforcers for a capitalist-imperialist system that enforces vicious exploitation and savage oppression on Black people and other people here in this country, to say nothing of what it does around the world. We need a revolution to get rid of this system and to bring in a totally different, far better system…I am talking reality. Let’s talk about Alton Sterling, a man who was beaten down, tasered, pinned down on the ground and then police pull out a gun after they immobilized him and shoot him several times. Let’s talk about Eric Garner; a man who was doing nothing wrong and police choked him to death. Let’s talk about the fact that those and all other hundreds of other killer cops have all been exonerated. That is the reality that no one should accept. Don’t tell me the stuff about police having a tough job because it is not hard not to murder people. You just have to not shoot them in the back, choke them to death, tase them to death, beat them to death. That’s not that hard. \\xa0 RT: The Black Lives Matter movement surely has a point. We've seen dozens of unarmed black people killed by the police this year alone. Surely you accept something has to be done? Katie Hopkins: I think that you are taking a small slice of this argument. What you need to look at is that black-on-black killing is far greater, it is off the chart; gang killing is off the chart. And these guys are just making a protest statement, they are creating hostility, and as a result in Baton Rouge cops are being gunned down. These gentlemen and ladies are out here doing a fantastic job protecting civilians. That is what we need. And people like Carl are creating the very kind of environment that Trump will flourish in because he is talking about law and order. And what we need is people that will stand up because Blue lives matter and Black lives do not matter more.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner on Saturday night, Obama said he would take it as an “insult to [his] legacy” if there isn’t a strong black turnout for Clinton. \"My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,\" he said. \"Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot, ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.” Obama used the civil rights movement and the struggle to enable African Americans to get the vote to remind the audience of the importance of casting their ballots. “I am reminded of all those folks who had to count bubbles in a bar of soap, beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi,” he said. “Risked everything so that they could pull that lever. So, if I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn\\'t matter who we elect, read up on your history. It matters.” The president pressed the crowd to give him a good send-off by registering people to vote. “If you care about our legacy, realize everything we stand for is at stake, on the progress we have made is at stake in this election,” he said. Obama attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump’s claim that black Americans have “nothing to lose” in voting for Trump over Clinton. \\xa0“[Trump] says we’ve got nothing left to lose, so we might as well support somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people for most of his life,” Obama said. “Well, we do have challenges. But we’re not stupid.” Obama has been criticized for failing to do enough for black Americans during his presidency. Many Americans feel that the first black president has failed to make enough progress for the black community. The founding of the Black Lives Matter movement, numerous examples of police brutality against black people, and a lack of employment opportunities have been cited indications that Obama has not done enough. Mr. Obama I take your 8 years of higher crime, terrorism, illegals, unemployment, food stamps & War on👮 as a personal slap to the face of 🇺🇸 Obama claims that Trump is out to ruin his legacy, no honey, Trump is out to #MAGA. You ruined your own legacy by being a terrible president On the other hand, Obama has been commended for granting clemency to prisoners charged with minor offences, and has recently announced the phasing out of the so-called, for profit prisons. Obama pushed for a $75 million police body camera program in response to the police killings of unarmed black men, and created initiatives to support black youths. I wish we saw more Reverend Obama during his tenure. https://t.co/fW4Fp6eTcX Clinton also spoke at the event, where she received the Trailblazer award for being the first female presidential candidate for a major US political party. She praised the Obama family and dismissed Trump’s ‘birther’ comments. Obama joked with the crowd about Trump’s declaration that Obama was in fact born in the US. The billionaire businessman recently convened a press conference to announce that he no longer believes Obama was not born in America. “There’s an extra spring in my step tonight. I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change ― none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. And to think that with just 124 days to go, under the wire we got that resolved. That’s a boost for me in the home stretch.”  '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'In a nutshell, the non-stop drama, as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) diplomats told me, is all about “escalation-management protocols.” Translation: how to prevent any unilateral outburst that could be interpreted as warlike. Compounding the problem is that ASEAN can’t seem to manage its own internal protocols. This past Tuesday offered a graphic illustration, after a special ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Yuxi. First ASEAN\\xa0issued a communiqué. Then it retracted it. As much as that reflects internal dissent among the 10 nation group, it also happens to puncture the Pentagon myth of China’s “isolation”. Meanwhile, a D-Day is approaching; the ruling, by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, on a territorial dispute brought by the Philippines in 2013. The ruling should come by late July or early August. Even if – as expected – it goes against Beijing that still should not be reason to install an insurmountable ASEAN-China divide. Connie Rahakundini, president of the Indonesian Institute for Maritime Studies (IIMS),\\xa0framed the question for Xinhua. There is an ‘ASEAN plus’ mechanism already in place – which is a sort of debate forum including China. And ASEAN is also establishing a code of conduct to prevent unilateral moves. The problem with the case in The Hague is that the Philippines did not try to solve it bilaterally; off the record, ASEAN diplomats admit that would be the only solution. So no wonder Beijing decided not to be a part of the arbitration procedure, and preemptively rejects whatever ruling (which is non-binding anyway), insisting the court has no jurisdiction. The Philippines case is about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation; these are subject to general international law, not the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). At the recent Shangri-La dialogue, Beijing once again detailed its complex strategy in the South China Sea. PLA Major General Yunzhu Yao stressed that freedom of navigation for commercial ships in the South China Sea has not been challenged and would never be challenged. And she hit the heart of the matter; the US has not ratified UNCLOS, so it’s in no position to impose its interpretation of the treaty on any nation, in Asia or beyond. Compare it to Rahkundini, speaking for ASEAN as a whole: \"The United States actually has nothing to do in the South China Sea; moreover it does not ratify the UNCLOS. So it is not appropriate for the United States to meddle or, even worse, demonstrate military might there. The United States has to be wiser and fairer to see the ongoing dispute in the South China Sea.\" Everyone knows this is not going to happen. On the contrary; the Obama administration and the Pentagon are engaged in all out meddling, deploying “freedom of navigation” operations. For his part new Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte very well knows that the arbitration, at best, might give him a better bargaining stance. But still he will have to negotiate with China. And Beijing knows exactly what Manila needs to soften the pill; massive Chinese investment. US State Dept. accuses China & Russia of increasing global tensions https://t.co/sh5hPy5sTcpic.twitter.com/VctVProrJO Both China and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam, are signatories of UNCLOS. But steeped as it is in history, Beijing also stands by its 9-dash line map, with sovereign claims that reach as far as the Vietnamese coast and along Borneo. And yet even the Chinese map as well as the drive towards an aerial defense identification zone does not mean Beijing wants to imperil freedom of navigation in the South China Sea – as Washington insists. This is all about positioning. International law does not specifically forbid reclamation at sea. What China is applying is a quite audacious, self-described “blue soil” strategy. Vietnam, Malaysia and even the Philippines had been carrying out reclamation in the South China Sea for a while. China arrived later, but in full force – building airstrips, lighthouses, garrisons in neglected or abandoned islets in the Spratlys and the Paracels. Once again, this is all about energy; to harness an astonishing unexplored wealth of 10 billion barrels of oil and 30 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. In its search for energy, Beijing is focusing a significant part of its strategy on areas already identified, for instance, by PetroVietnam. And it’s using a game-changer: the HYSY 981 mobile deepwater drilling rig, which the chairman of CNOOC, Wang Yilin, describes as a “strategic weapon” that is part of China’s “mobile national sovereignty”. President Xi Jinping has emphasized over and over again that China will not militarize any reclaimed land. Yet the Pentagon’s insistence on those innocuous “freedom of navigation” operations coupled with USAF overflights can only be interpreted as provocations leading to further militarization. The Pentagon has never been accused of being geopolitically savvy. Their planners after all fail – or prefer to fail - to see that China’s island building, in the long run, is all about finding enough oil and gas to perform an “escape from Malacca”, a central plank of Beijing’s energy strategy. Beijing would rather have enough energy closer to home, in the South China Sea, than having its fleet of tankers at the mercy of the US Navy crossing the Strait of Malacca non-stop. No one knows how the removal of the US weapons sale embargo on Vietnam will result in practice. In Southeast Asian cooperation terms, it might be useful to observe the actions of Singapore – that trade/services hub doubling as a US aircraft carrier parked by the Strait of Malacca. Singapore happens to perform a superb balancing act between Washington and Beijing. Russia, by the way, is also officially neutral on all matters South China Sea. Japan protests Beijing’s warships approaching disputed islands in E. China Sea https://t.co/nLwIGj1fNdpic.twitter.com/ZXaymc5PEe China is the top trading partner of the overwhelming majority of Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia nations. It is a prominent member of the East Asia Summit. It is driving its own, Asian-based response to the Obama administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pet project; the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Beijing knows that the “principled security network” proposed by lame duck Pentagon head Ash Carter in Singapore has no chance whatsoever of becoming a Southeast Asian NATO. What this all means is that the notion of an “isolated” China does not even qualify as a bad joke told at a stuffy Council on Foreign Relations meeting. And that brings us back to what happens after the arbitration in The Hague. Something very Asian; Beijing and Manila will sit down again and try to reach a deal, without ever bothering to refer to the ruling. Face will be saved on both sides. China will continue to go mobile - in search of all that oil and gas. And count on the Pentagon to continue its meddling.

              "  'A massive investigation is underway looking for possible links between the five improvised explosive devices (IED) that were discovered in New York City and those in New Jersey. ‘Act of terror’: #ManhattanExplosion leaves 29 injured https://t.co/lbkMZ0hTCG Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI, William Sweeney told reporters on Sunday that an FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorism Taskforce, comprised of over 50 agencies, is analyzing evidence to see if all or any of the crime scenes are connected. The Department of Homeland Security is also actively monitoring and participating in the investigations. Two bombs exploded in NJ and NYC on Saturday. Initially, an explosion in a garbage container near a Marine Corps charity run in New Jersey took place at around 9:30am local time. No injuries were reported but the partial blast delayed the start of the race in which more than 5,000 runners participated. Later, investigators in New Jersey discovered three pipe-bomb-type devices wired together near the boardwalk. In the evening, across the Hudson River, a second bomb exploded in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at around 8:30pm (local time), injuring 29 people, all of whom have been released from the hospital after receiving medical treatment. The blast in front of 135 W. 23rd St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues was called “an act of terrorism” by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. On Sunday, the NYPD commissioner confirmed to reporters that the investigation had discovered “some component indicative of an IED.” “We definitely had a bombing last night on 23rd Street and we had a suspicious device on 27th Street,” James O’Neill said. As emergency and investigative teams rushed to the scene of the explosion, New York State police troopers discovered a second “suspicious secondary device” a few blocks away.

Three devices found in New Jersey and two in New York used old-fashioned flip cell phones as detonators, law enforcement officials close to the investigation told NBC 4, New York. But despite the similarities in the IEDs, officials have been cautious to connect the crime scenes. READ MORE: Pipe bomb detonates along route of 5km US Marines charity race in New Jersey “At this point, we do not have any specific evidence of a connection, but that will continue to be considered. So we’re not taking any options off the table,” NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Sunday. Commenting on the blast in Chelsea, de Blasio said that authorities are looking into possible motives for the explosion before establishing any connections. “Now we know from everything we’ve seen so far that this was an intentional act. I want to reaffirm what I said last night, but again we do not know the motivation, we do not know the nature of it,” the mayor said. “We only know it was organized. We know it was organized in the sense of some individual put it there.” Commissioner Jimmy O’Neill meanwhile said that the investigation has recovered videos from both scenes as authorities continue “to canvass for witnesses and additional video.” He added that a parallel investigation is ongoing between the NYPD, the JTTF, and the FBI. While acknowledging that there is no “immediate threat” to New York, Cuomo, speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday said that “on the side of caution, we will be deploying close to 1,000 state police and National Guard people to police the bus terminals, airports, and subway stations.” Cuomo added that “a bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism” and vowed to find those responsible. So far no domestic or international group has claimed the responsibility for either NJ or NYC attacks.

              "  'Speaking to German media outlet\\xa0Deutschlandfunk, Maassen acknowledged that the jihadists “possibly stand with their backs to the wall” and can “effectively face defeat” in the Iraqi city, adding that the BfV is “closely watching the situation in Mosul.” The Iraqi Army and allied militias backed by the US-led coalition launched an operation to retake the country’s second-largest city on October 17. “That is good. But this can lead to the consequence that this situation may alert its [IS] supporters in Europe, that it can lead to violent attacks,” the BfV chief warned. He added though that security services in Germany are preparing for such an event. “This is what we want to prevent and we also adjust ourselves accordingly, so that it can be avoided.” Maassen did not name any imminent threat facing Germany. Yet according to the intelligence chief, the BfV should prepare itself for “different scenarios,” including cases when “well trained fighters [who could] simultaneously stage suicide attacks or terrorist acts with Kalashnikov assault rifles.” This was the case during IS-inspired terrorist assaults in Paris in November 2015 as well as suicide bombings in Brussels airport and metro station in March this year. “And then we have the case of a lone wolf who is not really a lone wolf because, as we have now encountered in a number of cases, these people are being radicalized and led via instant messenger service, via the internet,” Maassen said. On September 21, police in the German city of Cologne raided a refugee compound, arresting a 16-year-old Syrian refugee over suspicion he was allegedly planning a terrorist attack. Law enforcement officials released a statement saying the young man had attended a mosque in Cologne and “has radicalized himself in a very short time.” The Syrian came to the attention of police on June 10, 2016, after sending IS-related images to his friends. German police are now also investigating whether a 16-year-old girl named Safia, who stabbed\\xa0a police officer in Hannover earlier in October, may have been directed by IS.\\xa0 In response to the case, Maassen said that Islamic State is increasingly trying to address young people via social networks to “radicalize them.” One of the most recent terrorist plots was foiled in early October in the eastern city of Chemnitz, when a 22-year-old Syrian national, Jaber al-Bakr, was captured after a two-day manhunt. Although a special operation had been launched by the authorities, the man was only detained when three fellow Syrians tied him up and alerted police.\\xa0 Al-Bakr later committed suicide in his cell. Prior to the manhunt authorities in Germany had reportedly received a tip-off from US intelligence services that the Syrian was planning a terrorist attack, possibly on Berlin airport, after intercepting his phone calls with IS in Syria. In July, Germany was shaken by several attacks committed by asylum seekers. On July 18 a man believed to be an Afghan refugee injured five people on a train near the town of Wurzburg. While just a week later, another asylum seeker, this time from Syria, launched a suicide attack at a festival in the city of Ansbach, injuring 15 people. In both cases the perpetrators had pledged allegiance to IS. '],\n",

              "  ' Economists are seeing this as a start of higher inflation, fueled by the pound\\'s near 20 percent drop since Britain voted in June to leave the European Union. \"The worrying factor is that today\\'s figure represents only a tiny part of sterling’s steep drop, and no effect from the second big tumble earlier this month,\" said Thomas Laskey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Despite inflation possibly exceeding the Bank of England’s (BoE) target of two percent, Governor Mark Carney said he could tolerate \"a bit” further consumer price growth, propped up by a weak currency. Bloomberg-polled economists expect the BoE to cut interest rates in November from the current historic low of 0.25 percent. “After years of undershooting, he must allow a little bit of overshooting. He cannot push too hard on inflation, it risks upsetting the fragile recovery,” former Bank of England foreign exchange manager John Nugee told the media. Government statisticians say they are waiting for clear signs of impact from the plummeting pound. The main factors of September’s inflation rise were the biggest monthly increase in clothing prices since 2010 and higher fuel costs. However, not all consumer goods became more expensive in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said. “There is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods,” said Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS. The UK’s biggest supermarket Tesco briefly halted online sales of goods produced by Unilever because of a dispute over potential price increases. The news about the inflation rate pushed the pound higher against the dollar. The British currency is almost one percent up on Tuesday against the greenback, trading at 1.2280. '],\n",

According to Sebastien who lived next to him, Bouhlel did not seem overly religious, was often dressed in shorts and sometimes wore work boots. #NiceAttack LATEST:- 84 killed- 100+ injured- 54 children hospitalized- Driver IDd as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel https://t.co/MUYkMroWTm Meanwhile, the attacker’s brother told journalists he does not believe that Bouhlel could commit a terrorist attack out of religious motives as he was not religious at all. “Mohamed could not do anything like this. He did not pray, he was not religious, he did not observe religious rituals. I do not believe that he could do it out of religious or extremist motives,” the attacker’s brother said, adding that Bouhlel was actually planning to go on vacation to the Tunisian city of Sousse in the coming days. He was “a good-looking man who kept giving my two daughters the eye,” one female neighbor told the paper. “He was divorcing or divorced with three kids,” another neighbor Mohammed said, adding that that Bouhlel had been very nervous recently. Bouhlel also reportedly suffered from depression because of a divorce and financial problems. \"I would say he was someone who was pleasing to women,\"\\xa0 Hanan, also a neighbor, told Reuters. \"But he was frightening. He didn\\'t have a frightening face, but ... a look. He would stare at the children a lot,\" he added.

A year after his arrival, he reportedly got into a traffic accident that led to his arrest. In March of 2016, he was arrested again – this time for “road rage” – and convicted for the first time, French Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said, as reported by Reuters. “There was an altercation between him and another driver and he hurled a wooden pallet at the man,” Urvoas told reporters.

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  'Editor\\'s note: Arne Ljungqvist\\'s position was previously misreported as WADA vice chairman.\\xa0This article has been changed to reflect his former status as WADA vice president. Ljungqvist, who served as WADA vice-president from 2008 to 2013, made the admissions in a documentary film shown on Russian television station Channel One. The program led an investigation into the allegedly falsified Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) documents that allowed many athletes to take the banned drugs. The investigation was based on information published by hacker group ‘Fancy Bears’, which revealed six lists of athletes who have been granted TUEs permitting them to take medication at the time of competition. The lists named 127 athletes, including American tennis champion Serena Williams, British cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins, and Team USA’s four-time Olympic gymnastics gold medalist Simone Biles, who confessed that she suffers from ADHD and takes medication that contains banned substances, on the advice of doctors. “When talks began on the topic of TUEs, there were a lot of disagreements in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) hierarchy. If an athlete is suffering from illness and needs to take strong medication, then it is not worth them competing,” Ljungqvist said in the program. “ADHD in teenagers did not present any issue as they rarely compete at the highest level. But when these diagnoses were made for adults, it caused greater problems. There are some high-level athletes using that diagnosis - we know who they are, and you know who they are,” he added. Danish cyclist Michael Rasmussen, winner of the Tour de France in 2005 and 2006, admitted to doping from 1998-2001. He revealed that in many instances where diagnoses are made that give athletes permission to take banned substances, the doctors’ decisions are bogus. “I didn’t have any injuries or illnesses that could warrant a TUE, but I don’t think I am the only one who doped, otherwise I would have always been first. Everything is done quite easily: you write to them saying you have an injury, what medication you need, including a seal of approval by the doctor of the diagnosis, which is forged. In five minutes you can get permission to use banned substances,” he said, TASS reported. “They let me know about TUEs the moment I signed a contract with a top team. We all planned in advance, the doctor said, when we needed to take the substance glucocorticosteroid when you succumbed to fatigue, I could lose weight, but nevertheless not feel weakness in my muscles or any weariness,” he added. On 20 July, Norwegian cross-country skier Martin Johnsrud Sundby was banned from competition for two months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for an anti-doping rule violation. His use of asthma medication salbutamol resulted in the test levels of his urine sample exceeding the limits set in anti-doping rules. \"WADA remain tolerant to the asthma issue - even without TUEs it allows as much as 1600 mcg (16 inhalations) on a daily basis,\" the authors of the film say. \"But the dose of the drug used by one of the Norwegian skiers was not just a bit higher, it exceeds the norm by nine times.” According to an investigation by the Norwegian media, 46 of Norway’s 61 Olympic champions since 1992 have used asthma medication which contains banned substances.

The dramatic surge in UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia has been decried by Amnesty International (AI) UK, which warns of grave human rights violations in Yemen. UK is breaking the Arms Trade Treaty with reckless sales to Saudi Arabia, say top lawyers https://t.co/VC1ZMzSfn2pic.twitter.com/DS8H674Sav “These figures are deeply worrying, showing that the UK continued to dispatch huge amounts of weaponry to Saudi Arabia despite overwhelming evidence that the Saudi war machine was laying waste to Yemeni homes, schools and hospitals,” the group’s head of policy and government affairs Allan Hogarth said. “As officials were signing off these sales, hundreds – possibly thousands – of Yemeni civilians were dying in a terrifying barrage of indiscriminate Saudi airstrikes in the country.” Hogarth said the law is unequivocal in the context of the Saudi-led airstrikes. “Any Saudi attack, whether deliberate or not, that fails to adequately protect civilians is a violation of international law,” he said. “And our obligations are equally clear – as a major supplier of Saudi Arabia’s weaponry, the UK is legally obliged to suspend arms exports.” >£2.8 billion of UK arms sales approved to Saudi Arabia since it started bombing #Yemen. https://t.co/QyfmjxRXA0pic.twitter.com/PD6M3UJaHi Hogarth dismissed government rhetoric on the UK’s arms trade with Saudi Arabia as “evasive,” and warned that Britain is flogging weapons to the Gulf state in full knowledge that they will be deployed to kill Yemeni civilians. He called upon the British government to face up to the reality of Saudi Arabia’s conduct in Yemen, “immediately suspend export licenses” for further UK arms sales to the Gulf state, and preside over a full inquiry into allegations of grave violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen. Conflict resolution group Saferworld also condemned the spike in sales, stressing that Saudi-led airstrikes had hit civilian-populated areas in Yemen.  “The day after the prime minister [David Cameron] claimed to be ‘trying to encourage a political process in Yemen’ and declared ‘there is no military solution in Yemen’, official figures reveal that in just the three months July to September, the government approved the sale of over £1 billion worth of bombs for the use of the Royal Saudi Air Force,” a spokesperson for the group told the Guardian. “This is the same air force that has bombed hospitals, schools, markets, grain warehouses, ports and a displaced persons camp and helped to turn Yemen into a living nightmare.” Robertson says Saudi airforce in Yemen hv been killing civilians using British bombs. \"Time for PM to admit Britain effectively taking part\" In December, legal analysis commissioned by Amnesty and Saferworld revealed that the British government is breaching domestic, EU and international law by continuing to supply arms to Saudi Arabia. The analysis was conducted by prominent international law experts Philippe Sands QC, Professor Andrew Clapham and Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh. The lawyers, who work for London-based law firm Matrix Chambers, concluded that the UK government is violating its duty under Britain’s Consolidated Criteria on arms exports, the EU Common Position on Arms Exports and the global Arms Trade Treaty by allowing transfers of weapons and other military wares to Saudi Arabia that could be used in Yemen. Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain’s arms trade with the Saudis on Monday, arguing the UK has the most robust export controls on weapons in the world. “In terms of our arms exports I think we have some of the most stringent controls anywhere in the world and I’ll always make sure they’re properly operated,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program. “We’re trying to do everything we can to make sure that the work done by Saudi Arabia is properly targeted and it’s right that we should do that. We’re working with them and others on behalf of the legitimate government on Yemen.” However, Shadow Foreign Secretary Hilary Benn called for increased scrutiny of Britain’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as the humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to worsen. Benn wrote to the foreign affairs, defense, development and business committees, calling for the re-establishment of the House of Commons committee on arms export controls.The watchdog was previously responsible for monitoring Britain’s arms sales, but became dormant in May 2015 after its chair stepped down. “Given the growing number of reports and public concern, I believe the case for a full and detailed assessment of whether there is a clear risk that British weapons might be used in violation of international humanitarian law in Yemen is now overwhelming,” Benn said. “I hope therefore that the new committee will urgently consider examining the government’s approach to these licences.” As Saudi Arabia uses UK weapons to bomb #Yemen, we\\'re hearing a lot about the UK\\'s \\'rigorous\\' export controls... https://t.co/dRZkizU9It RT asked the government whether it plans to suspend further licenses authorizing the sale of UK arms to Saudi Arabia amid allegations that the Saudi-led coalition’s aerial bombing of Yemen is violating international humanitarian law.\\xa0 A spokesperson for the government declined to specify and went on to\\xa0defended\\xa0the Tories\\' oversight of UK arms sales. “We operate one of the most rigorous and transparent arms export control regimes in the world with each licence application assessed on a case by case basis, taking account of all relevant information, to ensure compliance with our legal obligations.

Anonymous experts Kommersant talked to believe the pilot did not manage the diving rudder and horizontal stabilizer, which steer the plane in opposite directions – down and up, respectively. When the pilot pulled up, he put both the rudder and stabilizer in a sharp climb mode, somewhat fighter-jet style, plus enacted the TOGA regime’s retracted flaps, decreasing ascending force. As a result, the aircraft lost speed and got into the beyond-stall angle of approach. All this led to an uncontrollable dive, the experts believe. #Flydubai FZ981 co-pilot was fatigued, but 'tremendous pressure' made him work – colleague https://t.co/q2MXt7muUUpic.twitter.com/dsUDMxF2Hx At that moment, the voice recorder is said to have registered a conflict between pilots. The pilot that tried to force the aircraft to gain altitude apparently turned the engines to powerful take-off mode, forcing the aircraft to continue its climb. The other pilot believed the situation was dangerous and apparently did the opposite: he pushed his own control over to bring the Boeing’s nose down and prevent the sweeping up, while yelling at his colleague to stop doing it that way. “Wait! Where are you flying? Stop! Stop!” a voice on the recorder reportedly yelled. FlyDubai tragedy: 360 VIDEO of #FZ981crash site in Rostov-on-Don https://t.co/gPbxxoZfNDpic.twitter.com/1xCLeF34Kl The pilots’ contrary actions caused the controls of the aircraft to ‘split’: the Boeing 737’s onboard computer was receiving mutually-exclusive commands from the two controls, which are usually operated synchronously. This rendered the plane out of control. When they felt the plummeting sensation, the crew coordinated their actions, but it was already too late. The Boeing 737-800 was roaring at 325kph downwards at an angle of about 45 degrees. It burst into flames upon collision with the ground, killing all 62 people on board.

              "  'While fighting continues to intensify as the Syrian army aims to retake neighborhoods occupied by Al-Nusra Front terrorists and other militant groups, thousands of civilians still remain trapped in the midst of hotspots unable to break away.More than one-third of the militant-held eastern half of Aleppo has been retaken over the recent days, including a youth housing complex, located right next to a humanitarian corridor. Though thousands are reported to be desperately trying to get out of the areas which are under the control of either Islamists or the “moderate” armed opposition, the corridor at no time appears to be crowded with people, Phelan reports from Aleppo. Few reports that make it outside of the occupied areas and Syrian troops say that people are being prevented from leaving by the militants. Some 6,500 civilians fled the newly-freed but still dangerous Aleppo areas on Wednesday alone, and the number of people in urgent need of shelter, food and medical attention is only expected to grow in the coming days.Last week, the Syrian government also said militants were using residents as “human shields” and prevented them from leaving. At the same time the Syrian army issued a statement saying that rebels were holding civilians as “hostages.”“Permit those citizens who want to do so to leave, stop using them as hostages and human shields, clear the mines from the crossings identified by the state,” the army said in a statement. This week has seen a breakthrough for the Russian-backed Syrian operation to oust militants from eastern Aleppo. This allowed tens of thousands of civilians from recaptured districts to get access to humanitarian aid, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Tuesday.“The most important thing is that over 80,000 Syrians, including tens of thousands of children, have been freed. Many of them at long last were able to get water, food, and medical assistance at humanitarian centers set up by Russia,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday.On Wednesday, Moscow expressed hope that the situation in Aleppo will be settled by the end of the year, said Mikhail Bogdanov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister.On Monday, 3,179 people, including 1,381 children and 138 newborn babies managed to leave eastern Aleppo using the corridors set up by Syrian government forces, according to the Russian Reconciliation Center.Despite Russia’s humanitarian efforts, the chairman of the German Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Norbert Roettgen, and Green Party politician Franziska Brantner urged the Bundestag to impose a new round of sanctions against Moscow for its actions in Aleppo, Spiegel Online reported.

              "  'Russia’s oil output may reach 540 million tons this year, Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov told reporters.\\xa0 “And why not? It’s absolutely possible,” he said. According to the Russian Energy Ministry, crude exports to countries outside the former Soviet republics could grow by more than four percent to 255 million metric tons this year, or 5.11 million barrels a day. That would add an extra 300,000 barrels a day to international markets. The talks by major oil producers to cap production failed after Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates said they wouldn’t agree to a deal unless Iran was included. Tehran said well ahead of the meeting that it wants to ramp up output to pre-sanctions levels of four million barrels per day and did not show up for the talks. Saudi Arabia is pressuring Iran to stop increasing oil production as the two countries spar over market share. Iran has been trying to regain European oil market share by undercutting at the expense of the Saudis. READ MORE: Russia continues record oil production – energy ministry Saudi Prince Mohammed Bin Salman warned the kingdom could immediately increase output by more than a million barrels a day (or about 10 percent) to 11.5 million. “If there is anyone that decides to raise their production, then we will not reject any opportunity that knocks on our door,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg News. In February, Moscow and Riyadh reached a preliminary agreement to keep oil production at January levels. Following the breakdown of the freeze talks, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak told reporters that the “door is not closed” to future cap talks, but “Russia won’t be as optimistic as before.” “How can Iran be the reason for the talks’ failure, when it wasn’t even here?” said Novak after the meeting. “We believe the presence of countries responsible for 75 percent of the world’s output here was sufficient.” According to Novak, an agreement to freeze output may be irrelevant within months, “maybe even by June” because of market factors. “The balance of supply and demand will be restored as a result of lower prices and lower investment,” Novak said on Wednesday.

US officials have reportedly told NBC News that the CIA is preparing for a possible cyber-attack against Russia. The move, apparently, would be intended as retaliation for Russia\\'s alleged interference in the US presidential election, which is already being called the most scandal-filled contest in American political history. Russia vehemently rejects the claims and says the US has produced absolutely no evidence to support the very serious charges. It is said the attack would also seek to \"harass and embarrass\" the Russian authorities. RT spoke with Jim Jatras for his views on this latest ratcheting up of tensions between the two global nuclear powers. RT: Would there be any justification for the CIA launching a cyber-attack on Russia in the absence of any good evidence Russia tried to interfere in the US presidential election? Jim Jatras: This was given, it appears, as an exclusive to NBC; almost like a press-release that the government is giving out as a warning shot or really a threat against the Russians. And even though they are saying that this is connected to the election, there is no real evidence regarding the DNC and other things on WikiLeaks. What the statement says is that it is geared towards interference with the elections itself, with the voting. Anybody who is familiar with our system knows that that is next to impossible; we don’t have a single nation-wide voting system. We have 50 states and thousands of local, state and county systems, most of which are paper, most of which, even the electronic ones, not connected to the Internet. So the idea that Russia or anybody else could hack into those is just absurd. So, I don’t think that is what this is really about.\\xa0 “I think these threats coming out of America are very much in response to the leaking of many emails which have desperately embarrassed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic and also the American-establishment favorite. So, this is the American establishment retaliating and saying ‘If this continues, then we will do something back.’ However, they are basing that on the assumption that it is Russia that has been hacking all her staff. Let’s face it, [Hillary Clinton] broke the law by hosting thousands of very sensitive emails on her private server for which she has yet to be prosecuted. And it is very likely that most of the leaks come from the fact that her server was vulnerable because it was not protected. I’m willing to bet that the Russian leadership’s private communications are rather better protected.”- Annie Machon, former MI5 agent, told RT RT: Some have condemned the preparations for an attack by branding it \"direct aggression\" against Russia. Could we be close to a cyber-war? JJ: I think we could be. And let’s keep in mind that there are two things here that I think are really behind this - not interference with our election.\\xa0 As we know this whole “Russia, Russia, Russia theme” has been a constant of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. And maybe the Obama administration is trying to help her out a bit by turning up the heat and pointing the finger. Also remember, as of tonight, according to the news reports, President Obama was supposed to think up some kind of response to what is going on in Syria. Maybe this is part of what is related to that.  If the US \"clandestine\" pending cyberwar on Russia was serious:1) it would not have been announced2) it would be the NSA and not the CIA RT: What would the US be trying to achieve by launching a cyber-attack against Russia? Is it a maneuver to redirect attention of the American public from the elections by playing this blame game with Russia?  JJ: It could be, and it really depends at this point whether they actually do something or they just threaten. I noticed one of the things they are talking about doing is hacking into the Russian financial system. And that is somewhat worrisome because for about two years now Russia has been complying with an American law called FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) which essentially mandates turning over a trove of financial information to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) from Russian banks, which includes a lot of metadata and the opportunity to insert spy ware and so forth. So, the Russians may have made this very easy for us. RT: One former US intelligence official has stressed the importance of launching the cyber-attack in order \"not to weaken the credible threat of the US response capability\". What are your thoughts on that statement? JJ: I think it is kind of cyber-saber rattling. They are almost daring themselves to do something just to show that they can and then it becomes a matter of prestige. It is almost like they are daring themselves to do something that may turn out to be quite destructive for everybody (…) As the article said, there is some concern on the American side that if, for example, there was some attack on the Russian financial system many Russians would respond with an attack on our financial system, which would be much more disruptive globally given how central the American financial system is worldwide.

              "  'The two countries had hoped their players would wear commemorative shirts during their World Cup Qualifier next Friday, but football’s international governing body says teams must not display political, religious or commercial symbols on their kit. The English Football Association issued a statement on Wednesday confirming it would defy the ruling. FA statement regarding Armistice Day tributes at @England v Scotland. pic.twitter.com/4oRAKE3vAR  “We fully respect the laws of the game and take our founding role on the International Football Association Board extremely seriously,” it read. “The poppy is an important symbol of remembrance and we do not believe it represents a political, religious or commercial message, nor does it relate to any one historical event. “In keeping with the position agreed with FIFA back in 2011 and in what we believe is in accordance with Law 4, para 4, The FA intend to pay appropriate tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice by having the England team wear black armbands bearing poppies in our fixture on Armistice Day.” The Scottish FA also confirmed it “intends to pay appropriate tribute by having the Scotland national team wear black armbands bearing poppies”. FIFA has numerous options available should it decide to punish the FAs for breaking its rules, including a points deduction, but English FA chief executive Martin Glenn doesn’t think that will happen. “We are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the other home nations on this, we all feel very strongly,” Glenn told BBC Sport. “It’s not a political symbol and I think most people would agree with us. We don’t think we are breaking their law – we think they are misinterpreting it. I’m confident it won’t come to anything draconian.” FIFA’s secretary general Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura, who is set to meet senior officials from the four United Kingdom football associations at Wembley Stadium on Thursday, said the rule was non-negotiable. “Britain is not the only country that have been suffering from the result of war,” she said. “Syria is an example. My own continent (Africa) has been torn by war for years. And the only question is why are we doing an exception for one just one country and not the rest of the world.” The latest row mirrors events in 2011 before an international between England and Spain when then Prime Minister David Cameron wrote to FIFA to voice his concerns over the ruling. FIFA eventually allowed England players to wear poppies on black armbands after initially threatening to ban the team from competing. Former England defender Danny Mills has hit out at the row, claiming it is overshadowing the meaning of Armistice Day. He told the BBC\\xa0that the players could get around the ruling themselves without the authorities getting involved. “If the players are that insistent on wearing poppies, they should get a temporary tattoo, stick it on the back of their hand and, when the national anthems are played, put your hand on your heart and it’s there for everybody to see. “FIFA cannot stop that. It’s no different than having a normal tattoo. “It almost seems like the FA are having a fight for the sake of it. It’s becoming about the (English) FA and FIFA rather than actually remembering all those who have lost their lives. “We’re starting to lose what the poppy is about.” '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'News of the security lapse emerged mid-flight from Paris to Toronto on June 3. There were 325 passengers and 12 crew on board. When they landed at Pearson Airport, all carry-on items and all passengers were scanned with a metal detector wand. Air Canada explained that the 17 passengers were “misdirected” by staff at Charles de Gaulle after connecting from Sri Lanka. They should have gone through an additional screening, but it didn’t take place. However, in another statement, Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the passengers had been screened before boarding the plane in Sri Lanka, and had never left the ‘secure zone’ at Charles de Gaulle. \"We assessed the situation in consultation with Canadian government authorities and determined the flight was secure,\" he told CBC News in an email on Sunday. Despite this, Transport Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) requested another screening after discovering there were \"passengers on board that had not completed pre-board security screening in Paris.\" CBC Radio host, Anthony Germain, was one of the passengers on board, and he told RT about when he first understood things were going wrong. “When we landed, I knew something was different, because usually if you land at a big airport like Pearson in Toronto, the plane – especially the plane with more than 300 passengers – would normally pull up to the gate. I was with my wife, we had a vacation, and I said something is not right here because we are far away from the airport.” An official came on board and informed passengers that they had only received notification of the flawed pre-board checks when the plane was already “halfway across the Atlantic.” Germain believes this situation is extraordinary, particularly in light of recent events. “I turned to my wife and told her, ‘this is very strange, given Paris and everything that happened in France over the last year.’” When the passengers descended to the tarmac to be screened, there was a heavy police presence, and an array of mobile X-Ray machines. Everybody including the crew was screened again, Germain added, calling the situation “strange and alarming.” “If you take a look at how many billions of dollars the modern world has spent to face the threat of terrorism, with everything that’s happened there [in Europe], it seems incomprehensible to me that anyone could get through security not properly screened.\\xa0 “I don’t think this is an Air Canada problem. From what I can tell, from the answers that I received, this problem is squarely on the shoulders of whoever is responsible at Charles de Gaulle Airport,” Germain said.\\xa0 In May, the French secretary of state responsible for transport, Alain Vidalies, said: “No other country does as much as France for the security of its airports.” The situation comes almost a month after EgyptAir flight MS804 crashed into the sea on its way from Paris to Cairo.\\xa0 At the time, an Australian civil aviation expert, Geoffrey Thomas, told RT the security system at Charles de Gaulle was good, but not impenetrable: “The one thing the industry does fear is the \\'inside job\\' when you have an airport worker who might be associated with some groups.There’s always a possibility that something is smuggled on board.” '],\n",

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  \"The British press has said this week there is a record of irregular finances from the club’s owner - billionaire Thai businessman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his company King Power. The report claims that a deal with a business called Trestellar Ltd, who were used to market the club in the UK and South-East Asia, is under investigation. Leicester City: billionaire owners' deal with company run by Sir Dave Richards' son, which has no telephone number https://t.co/sIU1YB36pa There is a chance that Leicester used Trestellar to escape UEFA’s financial fair play rulings, with the sale of naming rights to the stadium and sponsorship of the team’s shirts clouded in controversy. The report suggests that Trestellar sold the club’s main sponsorships to King Power - a company already owned by Srivaddhanaprabha and as a result Leicester’s income was substantially boosted. Although this accusation is yet to be proven or any action taken, football club owners have long been incriminated for their underhanded financial mismanagement. Manchester City spring to mind when discussing financial fair play, with the Premier League side fined $69 million and handed a transfer cap in May 2014. Man city fan on @5liveSport having a dig at @PSG for financial fair play. Glasshouses an all that. The English club pushed the boundaries of fairness when the team’s owners, led by Sheikh Mansour, sold the naming rights to the stadium to Etihad Airways - also owned by the Abu Dhabi government. This long-term agreement was essentially viewed as the club’s owners unfairly pumping more money into the organization to be spent on players, with the commercial deal a front to mask the fact they had eclipsed financial fair play regulations. Paris Saint-Germain were hit with a similar fine following their extortionate spending after the Qatar Investment Authority’s purchase of the French club. That PSG and Man City can be in the rich list based on 'income' shows what a farce Financial Fair Play is. https://t.co/jh1EsQv4cE Financial skullduggery in football is not a new thing and the Italians have been some of the worst offenders in the modern era. Between 2004 and 2010, a host of Italian clubs, including giants AC and Inter Milan, were found guilty of financial foul play through manipulating the price of players and using false account tricks to pass financial tests from the Italian Football Federation. The most severe punishment handed down was a five-year ban to Enrico Preziosi, who was found guilty of an abnormal transaction between the two clubs he presided over, Genoa and Como. Malaga owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Thani’s time at the Spanish club has not had many dull moments, with financial irregularities also commonplace. The Qatari bought the Andalusia-based club in 2010 and invested heavily. Malaga break FFP = instant European ban. Man City break it = only a fine. UEFA are biased towards big clubs. However, in subsequent years unpaid bills and tax irregularities were reported, with Malaga eventually banned from European competition and hit with fines. The La Rosaleda outfit’s promise of rivaling Barcelona and Real Madrid has since waned, while Al Thani has gone missing to some degree. Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala are also another example of financial shenanigans from a club owner, with Suleyman Kerimov’s role creating a wealth of headlines. Anzhi owner Suleyman Kerimov will stop his financial support to the club if it is relegated this season according to Sportbox. The Dagestani billionaire took over at the Anzhi Arena in 2011 and promised to revolutionize the club. Big spending followed, with Samuel Eto’o believed to have been made the sport’s highest-paid player and Anzhi looking set to become a force both domestically and in Europe. However, when Kerimov stopped the flow of cash in 2013, star players were sold and the dream of dominating Russian football subsequently ended - with Anzhi looking like prime candidates for relegation this season. \"],\n",

The professor, who suffers with motor neuron disease, said although he was stung by the ‘Leave’ vote: “If I’ve learned one lesson in my life it is to make the best of the hand you are dealt.” “Now we must learn to live outside the EU, but in order to manage that successfully we need to understand why British people made the choice that they did. I believe that wealth, the way we understand it and the way we share it, played a crucial role in their decision.” He said wealth has an important role in academic terms, as the EU provided grants for science and for him personally in terms of medical care for his severe disability. New enterprises and “cathedral projects” are now being invested in and more must follow, said Hawking. He described these as “the modern equivalent of the grand church buildings, constructed as part of humanity’s attempt to bridge heaven and Earth.” “These ideas are started by one generation with the hope a future generation will take up these challenges.” These could help address a number of “global and serious” issues like “climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans.” Hawking warned that failing to deal with these issues would hand a victory to “the forces that contributed to Brexit, the envy and isolationism not just in the UK but around the world that spring from not sharing.” “If we do this, then there is no limit to what humans can achieve together.” '],\n",

              "  'If there had been any remaining uncertainty over the dubiousness of the proposed US-EU trade agreement, the 248 pages of\\xa0leaks have now removed it. TTIP was already controversial, but it may soon be the political hot potato that no one wants to touch. The leaks reveal that the deal includes provisions which would allow American corporations to exert huge influence over European regulatory laws, potentially weakening public health and safety standards to fall more in line with those in the US. And the kicker? While the US would be granted all of this influence over EU law and standards, there would be “no guarantee of reciprocity.” In practice the deal, if it was signed the way it stands, would give American companies much the same level of influence over and input into EU regulations as European companies have. If EU nations passed laws raising standards, American companies would be able to challenge them. If that seems like an arrangement that benefits one side more than the other, it’s because that’s exactly what TTIP is. No wonder some UK residents aren’t exactly delirious over the prospect of remaining part of an economic bloc that would consider a deal like that. Leaked #TTIP documents reveal scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU environment & public health protections https://t.co/WZRMGkS7n5 But the texts released by Greenpeace expose not only new demands, but efforts to fundamentally change the face of Europe’s basic safety standards, including “details of specific threats” like the “plan to end Europe’s ban on genetically modified foods.” It’s a race to the bottom on public health and safety,\\xa0according to the director of Greenpeace EU. In another particularly interesting revelation, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung\\xa0reported that Washington was threatening to block the easing of European car exports into the US in an effort to force the EU to buy more environmentally risky US farm produce. And, if you were among those concerned about the effects of TTIP on previously agreed efforts to combat climate change, the Greenpeace leaks will have done nothing to mitigate your worries — as none of the 248 pages of leaks made any reference to the supposed global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions, despite repeated assurances from the European Commission that this would be a top priority. The reasons for the secrecy surrounding these negotiations are now crystal clear. It’s not hard to decipher why the European Commission had placed a 30-year ban on public access to the key negotiating texts. If Europeans had known exactly what was being bartered over, there would have been even worse uproar. Now they do. It is a black mark on Western “transparency” and democracy that it was left to Greenpeace to provide the first real insight into how this trade agreement is being negotiated. \\'The words “climate change” were not mentioned once in the 248 pages.\\' Unlikely to appear after 3 yrs of talks https://t.co/EmDL9R28Kc#TTIP But what the leaks also reveal is that a deal is still nowhere near being done. The documents don’t represent a completed text, as Europe’s commissioner for trade Cecilia Malmstrom wrote in a\\xa0blog post on Monday. They represent the negotiating positions of both sides. Malmstrom argues that this makes the “alarmist headlines” nothing more than “a storm in a teacup.” On that she is wrong. Huge divisions and sticking points may remain, but the fact that Europe could even consider “negotiating” around safety standards to benefit American companies is beyond comprehension and certainly newsworthy. Malmstrom vehemently denied that any trade deal would ever lower Europe’s level of consumer protections — and it was a pretty steadfast denial on the face of it. Maybe her next blog post will see her admitting either that this was a lie, or that the deal is headed nowhere but the trash bin, because given what we know of the US’s negotiating tactics, it will be one or the other. You don’t negotiate with the exceptional nation and expect to come out with much to your name. EU leaders had already been waning in their enthusiasm for a deal in recent weeks — a promising sign that perhaps there are still some things which Europe will refuse to be pushed around on. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls had previously warned that if TTIP did not preserve France’s quality of life, the chances of an agreement would fall. Germany’s economy minister has publicly called Washington out for refusing to make concessions. Looking at the fallout from these leaks, it wouldn’t be surprising if that theme continued. Greenpeace: #TTIPleaks reveal US\\'s \"deliberate attempts to change the EU democratic legislative process\" https://t.co/vIWrYuVmDy Unfortunately, this is the point at which I must again mention Vladimir Putin. My apologies for the seeming irrelevance; but the powers that be simply refuse to leave him out of anything at all. Anyway, apparently he hates TTIP — which obviously, is a reason for you to love it. James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander, dedicated a whole\\xa0article to this in 2014. As yet another attempt to fear-monger by casting Putin as a winner or loser in something, it obviously misfired because it’s highly unlikely that any of the\\xa0hundreds of thousands who have in recent months taken to the streets over TTIP, actually give a toss what Putin thinks of it. Not that this would stop the deal’s few fans from doing their utmost to involve him in the debate regardless. In April, Judy Dempsey, editor of the Strategic Europe blog at Carnegie Europe, decided to\\xa0have a go herself. A weakened transatlantic partnership is “to Russia’s benefit,” she says, and TTIP will strengthen that partnership. This is rather strange because the transatlantic partnership had been going pretty strong there for a good while without TTIP. But now, Dempsey warns, the debate has been “hijacked” by a “highly organized” anti-TTIP campaign tinged with “anti-Americanism.” Imagine the horror of highly organized protesters marching against a deal they believed would harm their democracy. Abominable indeed. But it’s all Putin’s fault, because Russia is running a “sophisticated propaganda campaign that does everything to publicize populist and [Eurosceptic] movements and anti-US sentiments.” Only 17 percent of Germans and 18 percent of Americans think TTIP is a good thing — and it’s nothing to do with it being a corporate power grab that spells bad news for both Europeans and Americans. No, no. It’s all because of Putin’s propaganda. A friend of mine who hasn’t kept up with the controversy surrounding TTIP asked me what all the fuss was about yesterday. I explained, in brief, what the Greenpeace leaks had revealed. Her response was simple: “But, why would we sign up for that?” Good question.

              "  'Retired US Army Lieutenant General Flynn came under scrutiny in 2010 after an unnamed Navy Intelligence specialist accused him - then a Major-General - of leaking secrets to “various” military officers and officials. At the time, Flynn served as US military intelligence chief in Afghanistan. A number of US Army documents, obtained by the Washington Post, show that the informant shared “United States classified information” while in Afghanistan “without proper authorization.” As the case remains classified, the Army’s Judge Advocate General pressed by the Post’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, released only four pages of the “secret” investigation. Following the informant\\'s tip, the head of US Central Command “initiated” a “thorough” probe. Titled AR 15-6, it was conducted by “a properly appointed official,” who found no misconduct in Flynn’s actions. According to the papers, it was established that “the sharing of classified information was not done knowingly and there was no actual or potential damage to national security.”\\xa0 The Department of Defense Inspector General also reviewed the investigation and “concurred” with the findings. “The Commander, CENTCOM review the AR 15-6 investigation and noted the efforts to properly cleanse the foreign officer’s read-books. He further stated that there was no evidence of senior officer misconduct, rather there was keen attention to mission accomplishment in a coalition, combat environment,” the documents read.\\xa0 Hence, no actions were taken against Flynn. Neither has the probe affected his promotion to Lieutenant General as no “legal objections to the nomination” were found by Office of the Secretary of Defense and General Counsel of the Department of Defense either.\\xa0 With Flynn’s “exceptional qualifications and dedicated service,” his promotion\\xa0was strongly supported by the Department of the Army. According to the papers, his appointment as lieutenant general was said to be “in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the United States of America.” While the documents provided by the Post do not reveal the nature of the information shared by Flynn, he himself did not make a secret of the case. In an August interview\\xa0with the Post, he said that the investigation on him “was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat.” Flynn called the probe “substantiated” because “actually I did it,” but stressed that he did it with \"the right permissions.” “Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please,” he told the Post’s Dana Priest, stressing that he was “proud” of what he did. The Post has drawn parallels between Flynn’s investigation and the case of Hillary Clinton, who has for months been under the FBI probe over the use of her home-brewed server and the use of her private emails during her tenure at the State Department. While campaigning for Donald Trump in the race for the White House, Flynn supported “Lock her up” chants and speculated that if he was in Clinton’s shoes he would “be in jail today.” Michael Flynn, who led \"lock her up\" chants, inappropriately shared classified info with foreign militaries: https://t.co/v3mc1vg1lA The Washington Post’s report has stirred harsh criticism from Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn, Jr., who accused the newspaper of spreading “fake news.” Another article by the failing FAKE news that is the Compost..should they continue to operate when they continue to get everything so wrong? https://t.co/m4YoNNnPJE Flynn Jr. has further accused the Post of forgetting that his father was “twice appointed” by the Senate even after the investigation.\\xa0 You seem to forget he was TWICE appointed by the SENATE AFTER the \"investigation\"... https://t.co/m4YoNNnPJE Richard Grenell, who Trump was considering as US ambassador to the United Nations, has also accused one of the Post’s authors, Greg Miller, of failing to “tell readers that General Flynn shared info on the battlefield about the enemy.” . @WashPost fails to tell readers Flynn appropriately shared crucial info ON THE BATTLEFIELD to protect US coalition troops. Absurd bias. https://t.co/eVnwDmDkJw WashPost reporter @gregpmiller fails to tell readers that General Flynn shared info on the battlefield about the enemy. *the battlefield*! Nevertheless, two Democratic senators have requested senior US intelligence officials to review once again the security clearance granted to Flynn. “Based on public reports, [Flynn’s] conduct in positions that require access to national defense information, and his subsequent private practice, appears inconsistent with the professionalism such access requires,” Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) wrote in a letter to FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and OPM acting Director Beth Colbert.  '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'In fact, it may be just beginning. Anybody who believes Hillary Rodham Clinton has been sent to the political graveyard by a Manhattan real estate developer has forgotten the cruel surprises of recent history (Remember the Greek referendum? Brexit anyone?). Democratic due process has devolved into something like ‘The Hunger Games’ for the rich - a sensational televised spectacle to entertain the elite every four years, while keeping the people believing they can effect real change. Although it may seem implausible to some, Donald J. Trump may be denied the presidency due to a democratic system that has been corrupted to the bone by excessive wealth, power and collusion at the highest levels. via GIPHY As the world media continues to eulogize Cuban leader Fidel Castro, the neocon-liberal establishment is quietly positioning their chess pieces for a power grab of epic proportions. As far as I can tell, there are three stages of this silent coup presently being carried out on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The first step in the process was to\\xa0perpetuate the news that although Donald Trump won the Electoral College (306-232), he failed to win the popular vote - reportedly by 2.5 million votes, at last count. Clinton’s alleged victory in the popular vote count, which\\xa0continued for three weeks after Nov. 9 (keep in mind that most of the vote monitors had already gone home as these votes were being quietly tallied), could present serious complications for Trump and his chances of entering the White House, as will become clear a bit later. Meanwhile, the blatantly anti-Trump media is conducting “thought experiments” to show how Clinton would have, could have, should have won the Electoral College if only the Electoral map had been spliced and diced here and there across the nation. The implicit media message behind all of this tomfoolery, of course, is that\\xa0Wall Street-approved Clinton deserves her coronation, because, well, that is what the elite want, democratic procedure be damned. This ongoing campaign on behalf of Clinton is much more than just sour grapes; in fact, it is a war of attrition designed to exert undue\\xa0pressure on the Electoral College, the rickety institution that got Trump elected in the first place. And although it has never robbed an election from a candidate who has gained the majority of Electoral College votes, there is a possibility – and a very high one in this particular battle - of so-called “faithless electors” tipping this contest in Clinton’s favor. This represents the second stage of Clinton’s attempt at reversing the results of the presidential election in her favor. The Electoral College is scheduled to meet on\\xa0December 19 to perform what, under normal circumstances, would be a mere formality of voting for either Clinton or Trump, according to the will of their constituents. Needless to say, however, we are not dealing with “normal circumstances.”\\xa0This is a battle the Democrats have no intention of losing, no matter what the Electoral College results tell us. The 2016 presidential campaign represents an epic power struggle that will determine the trajectory of US domestic and foreign policy like no other contest in recent history. No surprise, then, that neo-liberal lobbying groups have been exerting immense pressure on these electors to ignore the will of the people and “vote their conscience.” You’d be very wrong to think this couldn’t work. If 37 Republican electors essentially break the law and vote against Trump, it will block him from winning the presidency. The Democrat\\'s team of lawyers and political consultants are now\\xa0working around the clock to make this happen. Micheal Baca, a Denver Democrat and a member of the state’s Electoral College delegation, is one of the individuals attempting to persuade Republican electors to discard the will of the people and vote for anybody but Trump. Baca makes no secret about his intentions to override the Constitution and go rogue. “This is not about Hillary,” he said. “This is about trying to stop Donald Trump.” The Democrat full-court press is getting results. Art Sisneros, a Texas Republican elector,\\xa0confirmed this week that he would resign his position rather than perform his Constitutionally mandated task.\\xa0 Before continuing, let\\'s take a moment and perform our own \"thought experiment\" and consider would would happen if Hillary Clinton somehow gets the nod for the presidency instead of Trump. If the country is not completely overwhelmed by coast-to-coast riots and protests, and there is somehow a peaceful transition of power, then Clinton can expect to face four years of the most hostile, uncooperative (Republican) Congress in American history. Although given the number of neocons who openly support Clinton and her hawkish tendencies, there could be points of agreement. In a best-case scenario, there would be - aside from carrying out the necessary task of maintaining ‘law and order’ at home, while continuing on a war footing abroad - a four-year-long government shutdown. America would get its first real taste of what martial law feels like. The American Conservative\\xa0painted the following picture as to what would happen if Trump’s Electoral College victory were rescinded: “Constitutional government would have broken down, and we would be facing something like a Latin American presidential dictatorship. For several years, Washington’s political debate would be reduced to something like a Hobbesian war of all against all.” Is that something we really need? Apparently it is for some folks, and not least of all Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein. And this brings us to the final stage of a possible Clinton coup. It is generally assumed that it was Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate who masterminded the call for a\\xa0recount of votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. That’s not quite right. New York magazine\\xa0reported that on November 17 Hillary Clinton was “urged by a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers to call for a recount in three swing states won by Donald Trump… The group is so far not speaking on the record about their findings and is focused on lobbying the Clinton team in private.” Just one day after the above article appeared (Nov. 22), Jill Stein, who came in dead\\xa0last with about 3 million votes less than Gary ‘What is Aleppo?’ Johnson, announced she would be collecting money to recount votes in the swing states. One of the interesting things about Stein\\'s choice of swing states to hold recounts is that these are the very same places where Trump emerged victorious. Coincidence or not, that alone should have set off some alarms. In any case, the reason Jill Stein and not Hillary Clinton is calling for the recount is evident: Throughout the campaign, the media hounded Trump with a single annoying question never asked of the future loser: Would he accept the results of the election in the event he lost? When Trump said he would take a “wait and see” approach, Clinton assumed a holier than thou position. “Now make no mistake,” Clinton solemnly told supporters, “by doing that, he is threatening our democracy. The peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It’s how we hold our country together no matter who’s in charge.” So now that the tables are turned, Stein is in the kitchen doing the dirty work. And the media suddenly can’t get enough of this woman who haunted the 2016 election campaign like a rare phantom sighting. Here’s how News Busters\\xa0tallied her sudden stardom: “When Jill Stein was the Green Party’s candidate for US president, the networks only gave her 36 seconds of coverage. However, as soon as she launched a campaign to contest the presidential election and demand a recount of ballots in several key states, the evening news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC managed to find 7 minutes and 26 seconds of coverage for her in just four days. That\\'s more than 12 times as much coverage as in the entire campaign.” Shame on Donald Trump for objecting to #Recount2016, which makes it even more expensive: https://t.co/wzH7WiIFHl But it gets better. Stein has managed to accumulate a massive war chest to carry out the recount - $7 million at last count (or about seven times what she received during her entire presidential campaign). At one point, her recount drive was pulling in almost $5,000 every minute. Somehow that doesn’t sound like Joe Voter digging deep in his Levi\\'s; that sounds more like big league spenders stepping up to the plate. Incidentally, when Stein first started passing the hat around, she said $2.5 million would be plenty, thank you very much. Yet every time she hit the target, a\\xa0higher threshold was introduced.\\xa0 Is Stein’s recount campaign really about collecting some easy money while giving the Green Party some much-needed attention? Or is Stein just trying to shed some light on the dry rot gnawing away at the foundation of US democracy? All that, however necessary, seems very unlikely. After all, the recount plan was initially floated to Hillary Clinton, not Jill Stein. Thus, we must assume this is all part of a major power push for the Democrats to steal the White House from Donald Trump. As Paul Joseph Watson summed\\xa0up the situation: “Her entire campaign was backed by an establishment that wouldn’t hesitate to exploit a recount to carry out the vote fraud they thought they didn’t need on Election Day.” Exactly. And here is where we can fit the last piece into the puzzle to understand what is really going on here. If the recount effort alone won’t make much of a difference to either Clinton or Stein’s chances of overturning the massive edge that Trump now enjoys, then why are they bothering themselves? Hold onto your seats, folks, this gets interesting. The answer boils down to simple arithmetic, as well as some monkey play in the system. Presently, Michigan has already agreed to a recount, which will be carried out this weekend and require hand-counting of ballots in the regions. This process will take many days. Federal law requires the recount to be finished by Dec. 13 – just six days before the Electoral College is expected to cast its votes. Wisconsin has already agreed to a recount, while Pennsylvania is dragging its feet. In other words, this process will probably take us right up to Dec. 19 – the date the Electoral College is supposed to cast their votes (Why the Electoral College vote isn’t valid without these voters, who could go rogue, is a question for another day). Keep in mind that the total number of Electoral College Votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania equals 46. Now take Trump’s 306 Electoral votes and subtract that amount. This leaves you with 260, which is below the 270 required for a candidate to be automatically considered the winner of a presidential election. Do you see where this is going? Now if this recount should start to point toward a Clinton victory in these three swing states, this will present Trump with a very serious quandary. Should he kick up a fuss and protest the recount on the grounds that he won the Electoral College, this could provoke some sort of “constitutional crisis” that prevents the recount from being completed by the Dec. 13 deadline. via GIPHY Now, if the matter remains unsettled by Dec. 19 this could - technically speaking - give the Electoral College’s “faithless electors” yet more reason for not aligning themselves with their constituents. Or, on the other hand, the Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania votes could be considered forfeited because they failed to resolve the issue by the Dec. 19 deadline. So if it did come down to this, who do you think will be selected – possibly by the very Supreme Court that Trump hopes to disband once in office – to be the 45th president of the United States? Yes, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the candidate we have been told got 2.5 million more popular votes than Donald Trump (I would suggest Trump start a serious process to challenge those votes right now). For those who still doubt this possibility, please consider the two latest failed grassroots movements of our times –\\xa0Brexit and the\\xa0Greek referendum - two examples of ‘democracy in action’ that the political elite has de facto canceled or put on hold indefinitely. Such dramatic setbacks, which are becoming the rule rather than the exception, lend credence to Mark Twain’s famous observation that “If voting made any difference they wouldn\\'t let us do it.” In other words, the elite will always get what they want, regardless how the votes goes. Clinton seizing the White House through the backdoor would not be the strangest thing to happen in old Washington. Just ask George W. Bush how he got elected president in 2000 by the Supreme Court, not We the People. @Robert_Bridge The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

              "  'On the sidelines of Valdai International Discussion Club, RT asked experts about the prospects of US-Russia relations after the American elections in November. RT: What do you think about the power of leaders and their power of decision making to influence policy, regardless of whom is now in the White House? Do you think it will have a significant impact on America’s relationship with Russia, which has been used as a boogeyman by the Clinton campaign? Is that something that concerns American voters? John Mearsheimer: No, I don’t think most [Americans] care much about foreign policy in general. They care mainly about domestic politics and the state of the American economy. I don’t think that all this talk about Russia being a boogeyman is going to have much influence on the election. I think that Hillary Clinton will win a decisive victory and I don’t think it will change US-Russian relations very much if she takes office, as I predict. But if it does change things in a meaningful way, it will make all for the worse because she is a hawk on Russia, she is very anti-Putin and she is surrounded by advisers who are very hawkish on Russia. So, there is no reason to expect any improvement in US-Russian relations in the near future. I say that with great regret. \"Every four years, the Russian question becomes more and more prominent. I am not sure why this is the case. Haven’t they got enough issues and problems of their own to discuss. Secondly, it is almost certain that Hillary Clinton will win and therefore now we need to start thinking what political consequences will emerge out of that. On the one side (…) she initially said she would impose a ‘no-fly zone’ in Syria. She will temper that, and try to negotiate that, so it is not immediately a situation of war. But on the other hand, some of her team are talking about possibly the imposition of more sanctions on Russia. Now sanctions are a type of warfare, so I think that is a catastrophic way forward (…) This isn’t a Cold War, this is worse than the Cold War, the Cold War was about managing conflicts, this is about conducting conflicts, and that is much worse. And I am afraid that Hillary Clinton is one of these people who is really keen to continue and gets stuck into that battle.\" - Richard Sakwa, professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent RT: In terms of EU-Russian relations, the EU summit has just finished and new sanctions at least are agreed for Russia and the old ones still remain. Do you think sanctions are what is needed right now? Are they constructive, because both sides have obviously been affected by them? JM: The sanctions are all about the Ukraine crisis. That is why the West put these sanctions on the Russians. In the West, especially in the US, we blame the Russians for causing the Ukraine crisis. And the idea is that we put sanctions on and keep those sanctions on the Russians until they change their behavior. The fact is that the Russians didn’t cause the Ukraine crisis; the West did for the most part. And the sanctions are not going to work. But it is almost impossible for me to see the Americans taking those sanctions off any time soon. So, I think there is a little hope that we are going to solve the Ukraine crisis and I think US-Russia relations will continue to be bad.

              "  'The EU Parliament\\'s resolution demonstrates \"political degradation\" in regard to the \"idea of democracy\" in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. Putin pointed out that while \"everyone tries to lecture\" Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, \"which is not the best way\" to deal with any issues. \"The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one\\'s point of view should be presented,\" Putin said. Adding that he hopes the Western move to \"counter Russian propaganda\" won\\'t lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution\\xa0based on the report ‘EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties’, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to \"distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens.\" The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. At the same time, Russia is accused of \"information warfare,\" with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda \"tools.\" The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). The report also mentions some \"social media and internet trolls\" from Russia who are thought to \"challenge democratic values.\" READ MORE: Finland to host hub combating ‘hybrid’ threats posed by ISIS & Russia – official It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of \"investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media.\" It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO \"on strategic communication.\" Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists\\' organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. \"The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the \\xa0EU\\'s own human rights and freedom of press norms,\" reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was \"at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter,\" and that with an alleged \"aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries.\" \"The report is unjustified, it\\'s not objective and is one-sided,\" Greek Independent MEP, Notis Marias told RT, adding that the total number of lawmakers who voted against the resolution or abstained from voting shows that \"the majority of the MEPs in this house do not actually accept\" it. Many of those who supported the document are from eastern Europe, Marias said, while those representing the southern part of the bloc either abstained or voted against it.  \"I find that the resolution is going the wrong way, because we need to have better relations with Russia, which is better for the European economy, for security and this is the new trend in the United States that we have to take into account,\" he added.

Spanish MEP Javier Couso Permuy said \"it fosters hysteria against Russia,\" while British MEP James Carver noted the report is \"worryingly reminiscent of the Cold War.\" The Russian authorities have always treated foreign media working in Russia with respect, and have “never discriminated” against journalists from other countries, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in an interview with Rossiya 1 TV channel.

Moscow earlier said it would be forced to take reciprocal steps to the EU lawmakers\\' \"unfriendly actions.\" Having called the MEPs\\' move \"cynical,\" the Russian Federation Council member on international affairs, Igor Morozov, said that European lawmakers \"should be aware that their unfriendly actions\" would cause a \"very tough response\" from Moscow.

              "  '“Israel’s decision to declare 234 hectares near Jericho in Area C of the West Bank as state land is a further step that risks undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state and therefore calls into question Israel’s commitment to a two-state solution,” the EU said in a statement.\\xa0 The news of the seizure of 579 acres (234 hectares) near the Dead Sea and the Palestinian city of Jericho, was reported by Israel\\'s Peace Now movement on Tuesday. According to Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the confiscation on March 10, was made in accordance with “the decision of the political level and the examining of the professional authorities” which have declared the territory to be “state lands.” The land now in Israeli possession and unless a 45 day appeal process goes through will be used to expand Jewish settlements and for building tourism and other commercial facilities. The EU condemned such activities. “Any decision that could enable further settlement expansion, which is illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace, will only drive the parties to the conflict even further apart,” the EU said. “The European Union remains firmly opposed to Israel’s settlement policy and actions taken in this context, including demolitions and confiscations, evictions, forced transfers or restrictions on movement and access,” the statement added. Brussels is the latest international entity to have condemned the land seizure, the biggest since August 2010, when Israel confiscated almost 1,000 acres in the West Bank. The United Nations and the US were the first to speak out against the latest appropriation on Tuesday. UK, Germany and France followed suit in condemning the seizure of territory. The UK’s Foreign Office said that such “steps clearly damage the diminishing prospects for a two state solution,” as the office called on Israel to “end to settlement expansion, which is illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace.” #Map Israeli occupation declared 2342 dunums as \"state land\" in the southern #Jericho entrance #Palestinepic.twitter.com/kSIVkHrH98 “This decision sends a wrong signal at the wrong time,” the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Paris said that it was said “extremely concerned” by the Israeli decision. “Settlements constitute a violation of international law and contradict commitments made by Israeli authorities in favor of a two-state solution,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said. After the collapse of the US sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in 2014, France is taking an active role to bring together the conflicting parties for an international peace conference. The aim is to gather international delegations before May that would outline incentives and give guarantees for Israelis and Palestinians to resume negotiations sometime before August. On Monday Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the French proposal, yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined the proposition saying he would prefer direct talks with the Palestinians without any pre-conditions. “The Israeli side emphasized the importance of direct, bilateral negotiations, with no prior conditions between the parties and the (Palestinian Authority\\'s) responsibility to combat terror and incitement,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry statement said.

              "  '“The opportunity that [President-elect Donald] Trump opens to us is turning over a new leaf in relations with Russia,” Brenton said, adding that the incoming US president is quite enthusiastic about restoring relations with Russia and would likely pursue at least some initiatives in this direction. The former diplomat also stressed that such improvement of relations is badly needed as Russia and the West are “heading down to the blind alley at the moment” and their relations “are unnecessarily bad.” In his article published by the Telegraph on Monday, Brenton drew attention to the fact that the current Western policy towards Russia has led to nothing but further confrontation and worsening of relations. “Our present approach has failed (sanctions have boosted Russian determination), and if we are to avoid slipping into a dangerous new Cold War, we need to listen to the Russians instead of lecturing them,” he wrote. However, Trump’s electoral victory gave hope for the potential improvement of these relationships, as before the elections, “Russians really feared the [victory] of Hillary Clinton, who was even more deeply anti-Russian than [the acting US President Barack] Obama,” Brenton told RT. He went on to say that the US and Russia have a real chance of finding a common ground in such fields as combating international terrorism. “I very much hope that the very early item on agenda between the incoming Trump administration and Russian administration will be finding ways on working together on that,” Brenton said, referring to the issue of fighting Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. However, the former UK ambassador to Moscow also said that “in Washington, there is quite a lot of doubt about how far he will be able to go” in improving relations with Russia and emphasized that it just equally depends on Russia. Brenton called for caution in making forecasts by saying that Trump’s decisions are still interim ones and not the final ones, so everybody has to see “how relations will evolve when Trump [enters] office.” At the same time, Brenton criticized Trump’s approach toward NATO and said that the Alliance’s “unity” still plays an important role in dealing particularly with Russia. “NATO solidarity is absolutely crucial” in the face of “new active and troublesome Russia,” he said, criticizing Trump for the statement in which he said that the US may consider dropping out of the alliance because European members of NATO were not pulling their weight. Brenton called such an approach “mistaken” and emphasized that US “security is not just about America but it is also about American key allies.” Instead of planning to drop out of NATO, Trump should “encourage the NATO states to spend more on defense,” Brenton said, adding that the UK would “certainly” help the Trump administration in such efforts.

The biggest losers are expected to be Italy, France, Austria and the Czech Republic. Russians are looking for alternative destinations, and more travelers are choosing ex-Soviet countries that are not as affected by currency fluctuations. \"Georgia and Armenia have been the trend of 2015. These countries can offer a variety of activities. In Georgia, it’s possible to have a summer seaside holiday, go to winter sports resorts, a gourmet trip or sightseeing,\" said Rosenblyum.  Another reason for some Russians avoiding European destinations is the refugee crisis.\\xa0 “Many resorts are filled with refugee camps - coastal Italy and Greece.

              "  'The appeal asking to put Navalny in prison was formally filed by prosecutors but originated from the Justice Ministry’s Department for Execution of Punishment. The agency claimed in its original complaint that Navalny was not observing the rules of probation – on several occasions he has not registered at his local police station in due time and has not presented any papers that would explain this. Navalny insisted that he had valid reasons for missing the registration, and the city court accepted this and ruled in his favor. READ MORE: Moscow court upholds probation sentence for opposition figure Navalny Navalny was given a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence in late 2014 after the court convicted him and his brother Oleg of defrauding the international cosmetics company Yves Rocher of over $500,000 through an embezzlement scheme. The brothers had set up a private company to service an Yves Rocher transport contract, but the firm only accumulated profits while all contracts were executed by the state corporation Russian Post, where Oleg Navalny worked as a senior manager. Oleg Navalny received a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years, which he is now serving. Both brothers have never pleaded guilty and continue to insist that their scheme was an ordinary logistics business. Aleksey Navalny also maintains that the criminal case against him was launched by Russian government officials as punishment for his anti-corruption activities. However, this was not Aleksey Navalny’s only criminal sentence – in 2013 he was found guilty of organizing a business scheme in Kirov Region, by means of which he and his accomplices made profits while causing multi-million-ruble losses to a state-owned timber company. He received a five-year prison sentence, which was suspended with a fine of 500,000 rubles (about $15,000 at 2013 rates). Last month, Russian press reported that Navalny had asked the Supreme Court to cancel his 2013 conviction of embezzlement so as to remove the legislative ban that prevents him from participating in the 2018 presidential race. The Supreme Court has not yet commented on these reports. READ MORE: Navalny to seek participation in 2018 presidential polls – report '],\n",

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'RT’s Simone Del Rosario took a tour around the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve with Bundy, who led militia members and anti-government activists in a takeover on January 2. They believe that the federal ownership of the land is unconstitutional and that it should belong to the local community. “The laws on the books that are not constitutional, they are so tremendous, there are so many of them that every day you and I are breaking them and that’s part of the problem,” Bundy said. “Government has got to the point when they think they can make laws on anything.” Bundy says that people are left with the choice of either obeying the government-imposed codes or making the government follow the US Constitution. His group, which came up with the name \"Citizens for Constitutional Freedom\" (CCF) after repeated media queries, is not lacking in resources, despite what some have assumed. There are offices, bunkhouses, workshops and a mess hall stocked with plenty of food. One conference room, where CCF meets with locals or the militia-aligned \"Committee of Safety,\" is also used for storing federal government documents. Bundy admits to poring over files detailing how the feds interact with each other as well as neighboring ranchers. “We always put everything back in where they’re supposed to go, but we’re definitely looking through and seeking for different things, like, you know, how did they take so-and-so’s water rights away and kind of what their perception of those things are,” Bundy said. Oregon refuge occupiers dismiss armed supporters, start negotiating with FBI https://t.co/cR7RAjwoLXpic.twitter.com/JgJURpPLB5 The group has also made use of the federal government’s, or as Bundy would have it, “the people’s” heavy-duty farm machinery. In one case, they drove a Caterpillar loader to a fence separating federal land from private property, then they knocked down the fence to open up more grazing space for a neighbor rancher’s cattle. “It’s been used against them for so long, and now we’re going to use it for their benefit,” Bundy said. “For example, they go out and they use this equipment to build fences, and it cuts out their ranch, and so they can’t use it anymore.” While it is not clear exactly how many people are occupying the federal grounds, the passion of many is undeniable. James Stanton, a disabled and retired Navy diver from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico, arrived with a heartfelt gift for Bundy. Stanton’s old Navy uniform jacket symbolizes his past military service, and was dedicated to Bundy. For Bundy, it’s an example of “what’s happening across the country.” “I don’t think people would be here if they did not see that there is truly a problem, and that if they did not have hope that we could resolve it, and that’s what we’re doing here,” Bundy said. The activists, many of whom are not from Oregon, claim that they are standing up for a pair of local ranchers who are serving a five-year prison sentence for what they deem to be trumped-up charges. Dwight Hammond and his son Steve were charged under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act for a couple of fires they set on their own property, but which reached federal land. The first was in 2001 and was put out by the Hammonds, but the second, in 2006, was put out by federal firefighters. The judge that sentenced them ignored the mandatory minimum provisions of the law and sentenced Dwight to three months in jail, while Steve received a year and a day. However, they were forced back to jail after serving those sentences when federal prosecutors successfully appealed for the mandatory minimum sentence of five years for each man. The militia activists are also unhappy with the way the government manages the land in the area, saying it leaves little for local ranchers. '],\n",

Fox would like to sit down with the GOP presumptive nominee and discuss politics, economics, and “how the jobs are created.” “Yes, I would debate him here in the States or invite him for a free lunch in Mexico,” Fox said, even suggesting that they could “use national broadcasting, public broadcasting” for their head-to-head clash. However, it looks like the debate is to be a one-sided affair so far, as Trump may not even know about it. Fox acknowledged that he has not had any dialogue with either Trump or his office. “Not directly, not indirectly, no. First time I see a guy like him,” Fox said, confirming that he is now “officially” inviting the GOP frontrunner for the debate. Fox said he expects that the debate would lead Trump to listen to him and give him an opportunity to put his “arguments on the table,” but both would follow “facts and numbers and not just lying and cheating to people, saying blah, blah, blah.” The Mexican businessman is quite serious about verbally challenging Trump. “No, this is not a show and I don’t want his $10 million he says he’d raise for a debate,” Fox said in a reference to Trump’s proposed “nice sum for a charity” condition for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s debate challenge. “No charge on my side. But, the thing is we should listen to what we’re saying and that will be very exciting and very interesting for everybody to hear about,” Fox added. Fox has been very outspoken in his opposition to Trump’s presidential campaign and even had to apologize for using offensive language when referring to the real-estate tycoon. On May 5, Fox offered an apology for scolding Trump over the construction of a wall between Mexico and the US in February, when he compared the presumptive GOP nominee to Hitler. “I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall,” Fox said in an interview with CNN at the time. Trump demanded an apology via Twitter. FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Yet, on May 10, Fox was back to criticizing Trump, calling him “crazy,” a “false prophet,” and an “ugly American.” “Wake up Americans, he’s a false prophet,” Fox told the Kickass Politics podcast. “Think about it, analyze what he’s proposing. Count the amount of lies he says in every speech. Every day he lies and lies with figures because his sole interest is to do personal business, to get greedy, to get more money, to put the Trump name everywhere in the world.”  '],\n",

Finding ways to resolve the Syrian crisis was at the top of the agenda in a meeting between President Putin and his US counterpart Barack Obama, held on the sidelines of the G20 summit in China. Shortly after the meeting, the Washington Post\\xa0published a report describing the Obama administration’s “final proposal” to Moscow, adding that the US is running out of patience trying to pave the way for a ceasefire in Syria.\\xa0 The alleged proposal includes a truce throughout the country, including in and around Aleppo, “and the safe, sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance.” It also mentions prohibiting the Syrian Air Force from flying combat sorties against militants. “Once the truce is in place for a specified time period,” the report reads, “then the United States and Russia are to initiate a joint air campaign against counterterrorism targets.” The story, which cites several anonymous sources in the White House, also claims that Washington expects to receive a response from Moscow “in the next several days.” According to Peskov, the story “is not fully relevant.” The Kremlin spokesman confirmed that “Syria has been discussed in detail by the two presidents,” adding that a separate, more thorough discussion between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry has taken place.

              "  'President Vladimir Putin signed the “right to be forgotten” bill into law on July 14, 2015, and the legislation came into force on the first day of 2016. “Under the new federal law search engine operators must delete – on request – links that allow access to information about private individuals if spreading such information violates Russian laws or if the information is false or has become obsolete,” the Kremlin’s press service explained at the time. Search engines doing work on behalf of the government or local authorities are not subject to the new regulations. The new law does not permit information concerning criminal prosecutions to be deleted or edited, even if the person has already served their prison term. In addition, a state employee cannot demand that information on their personal income or property be hidden. The search engines are only obliged to delete search results, leaving the actual information on web platforms untouched. Requests can only be filed personally, the only exception being parents demanding that links to inaccurate information about their children be deleted. For instance, Russia forbids disseminating the personal details, including address, of underage criminal suspects. The law gives a search engine three to ten days to fulfill a user’s request. If a search service refuses to delete the links, the person who filed the complaint has the right to go to court and get a warrant. Fees on indexing services for non-compliance with court decisions could reach one million rubles (over $13,000). Although the bill passed a first reading in parliament almost unanimously, criticism from internet professionals prompted considerable changes in the bill. Russia’s State Duma introduced some mechanisms preventing the elimination of truthful information and inked out a regulation obliging search engines to automatically eliminate links older than three years.

Syrian troops have started a major counter-offensive. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Syrian army with Russian air support managed to repel several attacks on Palmyra, killing up to 300 jihadists. READ MORE:\\xa0Peace in Syria - it's the last thing the US wants RT:\\xa0Reacting to the reports in Palmyra, the French foreign minister has accused Russia of losing that city and swapping it for Aleppo. How appropriate is that statement? Peter Ford: It is a gross distortion. And what is actually interesting is that the American-led coalition, which has very powerful surveillance tools, failed apparently to pick up the 4,000 ISIS jihadists making their way to Palmyra with all the equipment and trucks. Failed to pick these up and didn’t lift a finger to try to stop it happening. Now we can only speculate why they did that, but I don’t think you have to be genius to work out that there are plans to decamp the ISIS rebels from Mosul into eastern Syria. This will play into the American narrative that Assad can’t control the countryside in Syria and that he is not a good ally in the fight against ISIS. In fact, the opposite is the case. Once the 50,000 Syrian government forces who are currently engaged in Aleppo are released from those duties, then they can turn their attention to ISIS. Ray Finch, UKIP MEP, told RT: “The fact is, this is ISIS’ last chance. It is a diversionary tactic; they’ve swept in while all the business is going on elsewhere. And it is going to be basically their last holdouts. They know Palmyra is an archeologically sensitive city, so they want to drag some attention onto it and say: “Look, we are still here.” But in the end they are going to go.” RT:\\xa0Russia's military says the bulk of ISIS's reinforcements came from Mosul. What's your assessment on how the terrorists have managed to regroup? PF: There has been a trickle over an extended period, and there has also been a flow from Raqqa itself. ISIS was preparing a bolt hole for the eventuality that they will lose Raqqa and they will transfer their capital to Palmyra. It may be in the back of their minds. And the American strategy plays into this. We can forecast a scenario where Mosul is on the verge of falling to the Iraqi US-backed forces, and safe passage is arranged for ISIS fighters. Where would they go? Of course, they will be dumped on Syria – the ideal outcome from the Obama administration point of view.

              "  '“It’s quite a coincidence” that Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy for over four years, was left without internet on Saturday “shortly after Julian and WikiLeaks had published the Goldman Sachs speeches that Hillary had been giving,” Stoeckley said.\\xa0 “Obviously, the State Department is going to claim that they aren’t involved in this. They’ve lied in the past and they’ve also exaggerated many claims about what damage was done by the WikiLeaks. Where, in fact… there was no damage whatsoever. And it was, actually, just embarrassment,” he said. According to the activist, the State Department is rooting for Clinton in the US presidential election to take place on November 8. “It seems to me that the State Department, who’s chummy with Hillary Clinton because she was the Secretary of State (in 2009-2013), would try to control anything that might come out before this election,” he said. Despite the internet cutoff, “the relationship between Ecuador and WikiLeaks and Julian Assange is still very amicable. They’ve been a wonderful host for letting him be a guest for four years,” Stoeckley said. Stoeckley again urged Swedish authorities to drop sexual assault allegations against Assange to finally allow the WikiLeaks founder to leave the Ecuadorian embassy. “Sweden, the US and UK need to end the prosecution against him. And this ongoing case in the US and whatever is going on Sweden needs to come to an end because the UN has said there’s been a huge violation of human rights. There’s no evidence against Julian,” the activist said. When asked if there would be an even greater clampdown on whistleblowers in the weeks before the US vote, Stoeckley replied that “it doesn’t really matter.” “What really matters is showing the inside workings of how Hillary has run her campaign; how the DNC has run their campaign. It seems as though she’s going to win. So we need to be looking forward into what her administration is going to be like and how she plans to continue to run in four years,” he said. Blaming WikiLeaks for trying to thwart the election is useless as it’s “a little late” to do it at this point, the activist said. “And I also think that it’s never been Julian’s motive. He would certainly publish anything that came forward on Donald Trump as well. Unfortunately, nothing has,” he said. Ecuador said that Assange’s internet cutoff was a temporary measure, explaining it by the WikiLeaks intervention in the US presidential election. \"The Government of Ecuador respects the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states. It does not interfere in external electoral processes, nor does it favor any particular candidate,\" a statement by the Ecuadorian authorities said. \\xa0 READ MORE: It’s Russia & RT!

              "  \"A new poll by YouGov, commissioned by the Media Reform Coalition (MRC), has revealed that 45 percent of Britons want the government to spend more on public services and raise taxes for the rich. Only 13 percent support the spending cuts promoted by the Conservatives over the last six years. But while Corbyn has championed anti-austerity policies for years now, polls suggest people still regard the Tories as having the best strategy on fiscal and economic issues. Thirty-six percent said they did not know whose ideas were best, while 30 percent trusted the Tories the most, against 16 percent for Labour. On all fronts, people seemed to prefer the policies of Jeremy Corbyn, but similar political views did not translate into support for the Labour leader. “There is a worrying disconnect between the economic policies that many voters support and the parties they associate with those policies,” said MRC chair and author Justin Schlosberg. “We feel that much of the media have been more preoccupied with dismissing Jeremy Corbyn as ‘unelectable’ than with seriously reporting on the policies he represents. “Since the economy is often the issue that wins or loses general elections, it is imperative that journalists now give due attention and scrutiny to the economic alternatives put forward by the official opposition, as well as other anti-austerity parties. This is not about a failure of communication on the part of Labour so much as a failure of nerve on the part of a great swathe of the news media.

But when asked which side of the Commons would be better at “overseeing the balance between public and private ownership,” it was the Tories that won (24 percent to Labour’s 16 percent). Media commentator Roy Greenslade told the Huffington Post\\xa0that most of the mainstream media had been “antagonistic, and sometimes openly hostile” to Corbyn and his wing of the party. “Overall I would say that Labour’s policies – if they exist, and I’m being cynical already – have not been covered in any depth,” Greenslade said. “Corybn represents something that the largely right-wing press believed was dead and buried, which is a socialist alternative to capitalism, that’s what really worries them.” He added: “If you go into a street and ask people whether they want to pay more tax, they say no, but if you ask them if they think there should be extra public spending, they say yes. You can’t have both, and these are contradictions are embedded in our culture and society, and don’t reflect wider media coverage, nor indeed do they reflect an understanding of what the parties stand for most of the time.” \"],\n",

They found that even the areas with average levels of trade competition with China saw suicide increases of 3.5 percent and a 24 percent growth in the numbers of overdoses. “Suicides could lead to more suicides or new economic consequences could take time to push people over the edge,” Schott told the Wall Street Journal.

In the House of Commons, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded to know why the prime minister had not attended Parliament to discuss the new measures. He accused Cameron of undermining the very principle he was attempting to achieve by neglecting Westminster. Europe Minister David Lidington, speaking for the government, attempted to pacify those who believed the draft deal is not strong enough, stressing the government is “in the middle of a live negotiation and in a very crucial stage.” Speaking in Chippenham, the prime minister laid out the renegotiation plans, saying he has achieved much of what he set out to do, and the new measures will allow Britain to opt out of “ever closer union.” He also says Britain will not be discriminated against as a non-Eurozone country and extolled the migrant benefit compromise.\\xa0 The prime minister confirmed that it may only be \"a few months\" until a nationwide referendum. Cameron is expected to have briefed his cabinet on Tuesday morning before the negotiations are made public. It will be the first step to a deal, which Cameron hopes to secure before the next European Council meeting in February.

Visegrád group leaders are worried that agreeing to the terms could affect their chances of winning in domestic elections. “The prime minister will be focusing quite heavily on the Visegrád group over the next two weeks,” one Whitehall source told the Guardian. “It is clear that there are nerves about how Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and workers from the Baltic States working in the UK might vote in elections back home.” UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the latest measures proposed by Tusk did not go far enough.\\xa0 EU membership means free movement of people. Only way we can control our borders is to Leave EU. However, the talks were criticized by Euroskeptics, who called the weekend a “choreographed charade,” which allowed Cameron to appear as though he is fighting for Britain’s best interest. Paul Nuttal from UKIP said the weekend had been stage-managed and was full of “theatrics.” “The theatrics and drama of David Cameron’s sham renegotiation continues and he is playing us for fools.” He told the BBC: “If the deal is that we are allowed to do it when we want, then yes, but if we have to phone a friend, indeed in this case 27 friends, to decide that we can put our foot on the brake, then no driver in their right mind would get into a car with those sorts of conditions.” '],\n",

It gives the users of the iconic electric cars a few new toys to play with. The autopilot feature has seen significant improvements, but comes with new limits on where the futuristic technology can be used. The intelligent system can now recognize curves on the road better and adjust the vehicle’s speed based on the information. However, drivers – or, perhaps more accurately, riders – can no longer use it in residential areas or on streets without a divider. Nonetheless, the CEO believes that autonomous driving will be ready for a true release within the next 24 to 36 months, when Tesla cars “will be able to drive virtually all roads at a safety level significantly better than humans.” “It’s probably better than a person right now,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a conference call with reporters on Sunday. Tesla’s autopilot software collects data from every Tesla car on the road and analyzes it in the company’s intelligence network, improving the system’s understanding of how drivers behave in certain situations and specific areas. Though it’s still in beta, the accumulated experience is then passed on to individual cars in the form of regular software updates. Musk told reporters that he concluded the updates were necessary after seeing dozens of videos of people doing unsafe things with the autopilot systems and posting the videos online. Perhaps the most significant piece of the 7.1 update is the long-awaited “summon” feature, which is also still only in the beta testing phase.

The murder occurred during a period of high racial tensions and violence as the state introduced school segregation. Tyler was released on Friday after pleading guilty to the crime. He was handed a reduced sentence of 21 years, but the 57 year old has already served nearly twice that, so he is now free. In 2012, the US Supreme Court ruled\\xa0that life without parole for juvenile offenders was unconstitutional. Earlier this year, this ruling was extended to include retroactive cases, meaning prosecutors could seek a reduced sentence for Tyler.

Tyler was on a bus packed with over 60 fellow black students passing up to 200 white students, some throwing bottles and rocks, when Weber was shot. Police found no weapon during early searches of the bus, but later discovered one stuffed into a seat - a gun allegedly stolen from a firing range used by investigating police, according to an Amnesty International report\\xa0in 1994. Having been tried as an adult and originally sentenced to death, Tyler became the youngest person in Louisiana on death row. A number of the students - black and white - who testified against Tyler revoked their testimonies after his sentencing. His sentence was commuted to life in prison after the state’s mandatory death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1976, and the state parole board later voted three times to further reduce his sentence. In 1980, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals called his conviction “fundamentally unfair” over the judge’s directions to the jury and ordered a retrial, but the court later reversed its ruling on the retrial. Angola Tyler was jailed in the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary or ‘Angola’, also referred to as the ‘Alcatraz of the South’, which is the largest maximum security prison in the US. He spent eight years in solitary confinement, a practice widely criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Earlier this year, the last of the ‘Angola 3’ was released from Angola after spending more than 40 years in solitary confinement - the longest period in US history. Tyler’s defense team, lead by attorney George H. Kendall, said the decision to release him was well overdue. \"It is long past time for Gary Tyler to come home,\" his statement read, according to\\xa0the Times-Picayune. \"Hopefully this agreement will help to put this case to rest for Gary, the loved ones of Tim Weber and St. Charles Parish,” it added.

              "  ' In microgravity, the only up or down is relative to the objects inside the space station, which means that cosmonauts can relax at any angle – providing that they strap themselves in so that their bodies don’t float away. In his personal sleeping pod – the only real place of privacy on the ISS, other than the toilet – Borisenko tied his sleeping bag to the “vertical” wall of his unit. With no day or night cycle, the cosmonaut wakes himself up with the help of an alarm clock, and his first action is … to take off his wireless headphones. “All of the crew members sleep in these every night, as the hum of the station is quite loud, and we need to protect our hearing,” says the flight engineer, who is on his second tour up on the ISS. “I personally use noise-cancelling headphones. They are not the most comfortable, but they let you get a good night’s sleep.” After a compulsory on-board systems check – “a perfunctory one that takes five minutes tops” – the crew members, if they are getting up at the same time, race to the bathroom area. Each cosmonaut has an individual vanity set with items for it decided on while still back on Earth. Many of the personal hygiene items – toothpicks, nail files – are everyday ones taken up to space, others, such as rinse-free shampoos and special wet cleaning towels are designed specifically for space, and have been perfected since the days of the Mir. “The shaver is an important item. It has to be reliable and high-quality, as shaving takes longer up here than at home,” explains Borisenko, as he dumps the shavings onto the air ventilation system (“any that are not sucked away will be vacuumed up during our weekly clean-up.”) Cleaning teeth is fussier, and together with a standard toothbrush and toothpaste, requires a bag of water for rinsing – which poses a problem once the ritual is over. “On Earth you would simply spit out the water into the sink, but we don’t even have sinks here. So, we have to use a towel,” says Borisenko, as he carefully dabs his mouth with it, making sure that not a single drop of water escapes to float freely through the ISS corridors. The towel is then dried, and reused the following day. As in any cramped flatshare, respect for others using the same space is paramount. “I am going tidy everything up after myself,” promises Borisenko. “It’s always unpleasant when you come to clean yourself up in the morning, and there are smears on the mirror left from the previous person using it.” With the cumbersome but reassuring sequence complete, Borisenko is now ready for the first meal of the day – breakfast in space. But that deserves its own separate instalment. You can watch the next video (and previous transmissions) from Space 360\\xa0on our dedicated website, available in six languages.

Much like that fight, the winner of the Kovalev-Ward bout will most likely be regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. Purse figures for the fight released earlier by the Nevada State Athletic Commission revealed that Kovalev will receive a guaranteed $2 million prize, while Ward will receive $5 million. However, the fighters’ eventual takings are likely to be higher due to TV rights payments. #KovalevWardhttps://t.co/2Xku6TxyTa shopkrusher.ru pic.twitter.com/EzaCHC0A30 Former super-middleweight supremo and 2004 Olympic gold medalist Andre Ward took the microphone first and was quick to fire back at what he deemed as pre-fight trash talk from Kovalev’s manager Kathy Duva. “I was off to the side trying to mind my own business and Kathy Duva woke me up. She started talking... It’s interesting that the ones that are not [getting] in that ring are doing the most talking. “[My team] get it. We watch; we take notes. But in the meantime we put the work in and then we produce come fight night. That’s what we specialize in. “All the talking is great, I love it. But know one thing: I’m not taking no mess come fight night. I’mma be there,” he promised. After a special Russian introduction delivered by legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer, Kovalev told fans that, although he has respect for Ward’s success in the amateur and professional ring, “right now we are facing each other, I should prove that I’m better.” “Maybe two three years ago, I can’t even imagine I get to this level and fight Andre Ward undefeated boxer and Olympic champion, gold medalist. “I very hope that our fight will be very clear and honest and to win the best of us. This fight very excited and a little nervous because I never was on this level. You will see very good fight,” he said. Kovalev, who told Larry King that he wanted to kick Ward’s ass in an earlier interview, reiterated his previous contention that the Oakland, California native is a dirty fighter. “He can punch with elbows and go forward with the head – it’s not clean, what I see. It’s only my opinion. Clean fight is a clean fight, not hit with elbow punches. It’s different; it’s not boxing rules,” said Kovalev.

The event was organized by American Jewish millionaire Lazer Scheiner, as reported\\xa0by Arutz Sheva.\\xa0 In the video of the event released on social media, Muslims and Jews are seen holding hands and singing and dancing. Bahrain, a small Arab monarchy in the Persian Gulf, has a population of 1.3 million people. Fewer than 50 Jews are among them, according to estimates from Israeli media. Hanukkah, also known as the Jewish Festival of Lights, marks the rededication of the second Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which took place in the second century BC. The holiday usually starts at the end of December and is celebrated for eight days. This year it began December 24 and will end by January 1, coinciding with Catholic Christmas and New Year. The Bahraini king marked Hanukkah for the first time back in 2015. Back then, he said that “the call to war against terror needs to come from the leaders of all the religions as one. “Here in Bahrain members of all the religions live with no fear, and we will continue to allow Jews to live peacefully and quietly, maintaining their lifestyle, their customs and the commandments of their religion without any fear,”\\xa0he added. Bahrain has shown signs of consideration towards the Jewish community before. In 2008, the authorities appointed a Jewish woman, Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo, as Bahraini ambassador to the US. The latest video of Jews dancing together with Arabs has drawn praise in multiple comments on social media, with people saying that it promotes peace and tolerance. “This is important as a potential beginning of inter-religious and international understanding and peace in the Middle East,”\\xa0one person wrote on Facebook.

              "  '“The critical plight that the children from eastern Aleppo districts are in – unwillingly taken hostage by terrorists – is surely a tragedy,” said the official representative of the Russian Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov. He criticized certain Western media for the “cynical use of this tragedy in anti-Russian propaganda material,” calling it a “moral crime.” “We have repeatedly stressed that the Russian Air Force planes operating in Syria never work on targets within residential areas,” Konashenkov said. “It is all the more relevant regarding al-Qaterji, mentioned by the Western media, as it is adjacent to the exit corridors for locals which were opened in the framework of the Russian humanitarian mission,” he added, as quoted in a Defense Ministry press release. Russian monitoring groups have noted daily terrorist strikes in the area, conducted using makeshift artillery mounts. The terrorists, the Russian humanitarian mission says, “target roads, streets, and residential buildings in the close proximity of the humanitarian passages.” “It is done to disrupt any attempts to receive medical and other kinds of aid for eastern Aleppo residents, who are basically terrorist hostages now. “The nature of the debris shown by Western broadcasters during the operation to save [the wounded boy, Omran Daqneesh] demonstrates that there are intact windows in a building nearby, and this in turn shows that the strike, if it happened, was carried out not using aircraft ammunition but a mine or a gas cylinder, which are commonly used by terrorists,” Konashenkov also said. The Russian statement comes a day after images of an ash-covered boy who survived an airstrike in Syria spread online. The video showed the boy, named as Omran Daqneesh, being rescued from a ruined building in Aleppo. Around two weeks ago, Russia and Syria began a large-scale operation to open special exit corridors in Aleppo for civilians and those ready to lay down their arms. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry backed a proposal from the UN Syria envoy to carry out 48-hour weekly ceasefires to deliver humanitarian relief to Aleppo residents. The first truce could be held next week.  '],\n",

Children respond to immigration decision: I am American #SCOTUSpic.twitter.com/DK7RW1fCk3 The Obama administration in late 2014 began its attempt to bypass Congress with an executive order that would have granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. However, lower courts have since blocked its implementation after 25 states joined Texas in a lawsuit against the order that claimed that such an action was not within the president’s power. The administration continuously appealed as courts ruled against block the order, until it reached the Supreme Court, which has had only eight members since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. A tie vote means that the court can’t issue a ruling, which effectively upholds the lower court’s ruling against the White House. The administration’s amnesty program is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA for short. It would shield illegal immigrants from deportation to allow them to seek lawful employment, and also expand an already-existing program that allows young people to stay in the country if they are under 16. Deeply saddened by divided #SCOTUS decision in #USvTexas. We should be keeping families together, not tearing them apart! The states that were against the move, which were all led by Republican governors, had legal standing based on the claim that DAPA would force them to provide government services to newly protected illegal immigrants. Current estimates put the number of illegal immigrants in the country at 11 million. The administration says that deportation of so many people would be unfeasible, but critics of this stance point at that the purpose of enforcement of any law is deterrence even if every single offender can’t be brought to justice. The White House’s proposal isn’t dead from the tie vote, since the issue will return to a lower court. It is very unlikely that it will go into effect during the remainder of the Obama presidency, however. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters that the House of Representatives came out in support of the courts’ rulings because it was an issue of separation of powers. “It’s a win for Congress and it’s a win for the separation of powers,” he said. “Presidents don’t write laws. Congress writes laws. And today the Supreme Court validated that very core fundamental principle.” Hillary Clinton said in a tweet that she was saddened by the ruling, echoing others who say that US immigration policy breaks up families. Unlike most countries, children of illegal immigrants born on US soil are granted “birthright citizenship” and have the option to stay. Their parents do not have such an option and can be deported. Today\\'s heartbreaking #SCOTUS immigration ruling could tear apart 5 million families facing deportation. We must do better. -H President Obama spoke to reporters following the ruling, saying that he disagreed with the outcome. “I took steps within my existing authority to make our immigration system smarter, fairer and more just,\" he said. “But today’s decision is frustrating for those who seek to grow our economy and bring a rationality to our immigration system.” The president also used the opportunity to chastise the Senate for not considering his nominee for the Supreme Court, using the court\\'s tie vote as an example of why a full\\xa0 bench is necessary. \"The Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision. This is part of the consequence of the Republican failure so far to give a hearing to Mr. Merrick Garland,\" the president said.

              "  'UPDATE: Trump says ‘he never was perfect’ after backlash over groping & married sex comments (VIDEO)  2005 was a big year for the Donald, it seems. Not only did he marry Melania, but he also appeared on both the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as well as entertainment news show Access Hollywood. But Trump may be regretting the latter, as he was caught talking on a hot mic with host Billy Bush. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump is heard saying on a recording obtained by the Washington Post and released Friday. While he had recently married Melania at the time of the recording, it is never specified when the events he described took place or the identity of the woman he is referring to. I\\'m sure John f Kennedy never talked about a woman that way “I did try and f*** her. She was married,” he continues. “And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.’” Unfortunately for Trump, it seemed that furniture shopping wasn’t enough for the married woman to have sex with him. “I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married,” he said, adding, “Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.” Bush also engaged in this discussion. As the Access Hollywood bus pulls up, the men seem to acknowledge actress Arianne Zucker waiting for them. “Your girl’s hot as s***, in the purple,” Bush says. “Woah!” Trump replies in kind, “Woah!” “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,” Trump says. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” This is like when you translate something from another language and Google doesn\\'t quite get it right. pic.twitter.com/7Q6Q9HThnt It gets worse. “And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything,” Trump says.“Whatever you want,” chimes another voice that the Post identifies as NBC’s current Today show host, Bush, who deleted his Twitter account on Friday. “Grab them by the p***y,” Trump says. “You can do anything.” It is important to note that regardless of star power or social standing, one should not grab another person by their genitals without consent. A statement from the Trump campaign called the conversation “locker room banter” and “a private conversation that took place many years ago.” Trump redirected scorn back towards the Clintons, saying “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course – not even close.” “I apologize if anyone was offended,” he concluded. While Trump may write off his comments as “boys will be boys,” other Republicans have responded by distancing themselves from him. As a result of the audio recording, Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan has disinvited Trump from a Wisconsin event. It was meant to be the first joint campaign event, but now Ryan will handle it solo. “I am sickened by what I heard today,” Ryan wrote in a statement. “Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. “ The whole \"everyone sins in private\" excuse for Trump sorta forgets the huge gap between being gross and bragging about sexual assault. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus released a short statement Friday evening, saying, “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” This is not the first time Trump has been accused of sexist behavior this month. On October 3, multiple contestants and crew from the Apprentice told\\xa0the Associated Press that his treatment of women on the show was questionable. Contestant Poppy Carlig recounted Trump asking her to twirl for him, but believed it to be “playful banter,” adding, “He said I reminded him of his daughter and I thought that was really touching because I know how much he values his family.\" It is a rare occurrence for Trump to offer apologies. This week, Trump was asked about a full-page ad he took out in multiple newspapers calling for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York State in relation to the Central Park Five. The Central Park Five were five minority teenagers in New York City who ranged in ages from 14 to 16 years old who were falsely convicted of a brutal rape in 1989. DNA evidence has since exonerated the men who spent between six and 13 years of their life in prison after the actual rapist confessed. When questioned by CNN’s Miguel Marquez on whether he recalled calling for their execution, Trump doubled down, saying, \"They admitted they were guilty,\" despite the fact that none of the five teens admitted to raping the woman and the confessions they made were believed to have been coerced out of the teenagers. \"The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.\" No DNA evidence was found that connected any of the boys to the crime, but semen collected from the victim did match Matias Reyes, the man who confessed in 2002. Since news of the comments spread, more Republicans have distanced themselves from him. Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz officially retracted his endorsement of Trump during a live segment on Fox News, and Utah Governor Gary Herbert announced he would not vote for Trump.

The decision has been forwarded to Interpol’s central bureau in Lyon,” Interfax reported on Thursday, quoting “a source acquainted with the situation.” However, at the time of the Interfax report, Interpol’s web-site did not contain any information about Khodorkovsky. READ MORE: Searches conducted in homes of Khodorkovsky’s Open Russia movement members The ex-tycoon’s press secretary Kulle Pispanen said in comments to RIA Novosti that she could not confirm the news about the search notice, adding that Khodorkovsky did not plan to make any changes to his current living arrangements. When reporters asked Pispanen about the possibility of Khodorkovsky applying for political asylum in a chosen country, she answered that the same question had been asked about three months back, and that the answer to it remains the same – Khodorkovsky has promised to think about it. In late December 2015 the Russian law enforcement agency dealing with especially serious crimes – the Investigative Committee – said that the former head of the Yukos oil company had been arrested in absentia and put on an international wanted list. The agency spokesman elaborated that Khodorkovsky was suspected of conspiracy to murder two or more people – a crime that can carry a life sentence in Russia. In June 2015 the Investigative Committee reported that it had re-opened the criminal case that was started after the murder of Vladimir Petukhov – the mayor of the Siberian city of Neftyugansk who came into conflict with Yukos stakeholders and managers and was killed on June 26, 1998, Khodorkovsky’s birthday. Five primary suspects, including Yukos co-owner Leonid Nevzlin and head of Yukos’ security department Aleksey Pichugin, have already been tried and sentenced, but the probe into their crimes continued until 2015 because investigators wanted to reveal their accomplices and primarily who ordered the hits. In December 2015 the Investigative Committee summoned Khodorkovsky for questioning as a suspect in Petukhov’s assassination. The ex-tycoon, who currently resides in Switzerland, called the law enforcers’ fresh move “a boring attempt to change the subject.” He also assured people that he had no intention of meeting with investigators.

Following a lengthy trial, in 2005 he was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in prison. In 2009, Khodorkovsky was charged with embezzlement and money laundering. The second trial ended in late 2010 with a sentence of another 14 years, minus the term that he had already served. After another legal battle, the final ruling cut the sentence to 11 years. In December 2013, Khodorkovsky was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin and left Russia for Germany to visit his elderly mother. Later he moved to Switzerland, which is now his main place of residence. '],\n",

              "  'The new investigation comes 21 years after trainee soldier Sean Benton was found dead with five bullet wounds at the Surrey training facility. He had been on guard duty and the original verdict ruled his death was suicide. Four recruits died between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, and in June another reopened inquest found that Private Cheryl James’ death in November 1995 was not the result of foul play. However the inquest was extremely critical of the culture at the Royal Logistic Corps base, finding evidence of bullying and a “highly sexualized” environment. Both recent inquests were forced through using the Human Rights Act which the government is currently pledging to repeal on the grounds it is used to attack the military with “vexatious” claims. Benton’s sister Tracy Lewis told the Guardian Friday: “Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death. For that reason, our parents are not here with us to see this day.” She said that the intervening decades had seen the family “tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut.” “If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain.” The original inquest lasted just two hours and Lewis said that it “should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey police that our mother had to fight for so long.” “We look forward to finally discovering the truth,” Lewis added. Emma Norton, the legal director of Liberty who is representing the family, said: “Just as with the Hillsborough families, the parents of Cheryl James and so many others, the Bentons’ perfectly reasonable questions about their son’s death were met with decades of stonewalling, silence and suspicion.” A date has not yet been set for the inquest to begin.

Encinia intended to give her written warning, but claimed she became uncooperative and argumentative. He arrested her and took her to jail. Three days later she was found hanging in her cell. A medical examiner ruled her death a suicide caused by asphyxiation. Special prosecutor Darrell Jordan said the charge of perjury is a Class A misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine, The Houston Chronicle\\xa0reported.

He added that fundraising and other operations will also be turned over to “outside parties” should the Clintons return to the White House. In any event, the Clinton Global Initiative will wind down after one last gathering in September, the former president said. Critics greeted the announcement as admission of wrongdoing. If the foundation were to become a conflict of interest if Hillary Clinton becomes president, how was it not when she was secretary of state, asked the Republican nominee’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Is it ok to accept foreign and corporate money when Secretary of State but not when POTUS ??? https://t.co/6PGLcvygIX The Republican National Committee called the move “too little too late,” echoing Trump Jr’s concerns. “After all, if everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. “Follow the money with these people,” Trump’s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Thursday, appearing on Fox News’ Hannity show. “They’re low-class grifters and gifters at every turn.” The Clinton Foundation has been source of headaches for the power couple for years, with Republicans accusing Hillary Clinton of engaging in “pay to play,” alleging that she sold access and favors to foreign donors while at the helm of the State Department between 2009 and 2013. Critics have pointed to the US\\xa0approval of weapons deals to Middle Eastern countries following their donations to the foundation. On Tuesday, an editorial in\\xa0the Boston Globe called for shutting down the foundation, because it represented a “political – and actual – distraction” to Clinton’s campaign. “If the foundation’s donors are truly motivated by altruism, and not by the lure of access to the Clintons, then surely they can find other ways to support the foundation’s goals,” the paper argued. “Even if they’ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort.” The Internal Revenue Service is now reportedly looking into the foundation’s records. There have also been reports that the Clintons have hired a cybersecurity firm, amid fears that the foundation’s computers may have been hacked. No announcement was made about the Clinton Family Foundation, a separate entity. That nonprofit received 96 percent of the Clinton’s charitable contributions claimed on the power couple’s 2015 tax returns. '],\n",

Видео опубликовано RT (@rt) Сен 1 2016 в 6:39 PDT “On August 30, Antonov [Company] and Aerospace Industry Corporation of China (AICC) signed an agreement on cooperation on the AN-225 project,” Antonov’s press service said in a statement, UNIAN news agency reported. The company added that cooperation between the two companies include the projected construction of the second aircraft of its kind in Ukraine and its handover to China at the first stage of the project, as well as the creation of an aircraft production line under a Ukrainian license in China at the second stage. Representatives of Antonov Company told UNIAN that each stage of the project will be implemented under a separate contract. The two companies did not reveal any further details about the agreement and said nothing about the project deadlines or the planned numbers of the AN-225 aircraft set to be built in China. Earlier, China’s CCTV Channel said on its Facebook page that Antonov Company sold all manufacturing rights and technological documents for the super-heavy air freighter AN-225 Mriya to the China Aerospace company. It added that the first AN-225 could be produced in China as early as in 2019. Antonov’s press service dismissed these reports as untrue. In May, Antonov’s deputy head said that Ukraine had been considering launching joint manufacturing production with China and was planning to invite Chinese investors to the project. On Wednesday, Antonov refused to make any comments on the deal and said that it will publish additional information about the negotiations with the Chinese company later, after its delegation returns from Beijing. AN-225 is currently the biggest aircraft in the world, with a takeoff mass amounting to 640 tons and a working load of 250 tons. It was developed in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and was initially designed as a carrier for the Soviet Buran (Snowstorm) space shuttle.

Triple giant \\'Tatooine\\' worlds have been discovered orbiting twin sun-like stars 🌅: https://t.co/n0x3VJzYHZpic.twitter.com/576F338T0T That planet orbits a star called HD 133131B which is part of binary star system with HD 133131A. A binary star system involves two stars which are close enough together that their gravitational movement causes them to orbit each other. Star HD 133131A hosts two planets, one of which is at least 1.5 times Jupiter’s mass, while the other is at least half Jupiter’s mass. Astronomers have found several planets in recent years that are very different from those in our solar system. The most-common exoplanets detected are so-called ‘super-Earths’ which are larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune or Uranus. READ MORE: Home from home: Scientists may have discovered an Earth-like planet with water But exoplanets the size of those found orbiting HD 133131A and HD 133131B are very rare, according to NASA, and have only been detected around a small number of stars. The stars, HD 133131A and HD 133131B, are extremely close together - particularly considering they are orbited by such massive planets - sitting 360 astronomical units (AU) apart. One AU is equal to the distance between the Earth and the sun (nearly 150 million kilometers). ‘Proxima b’ move-in ready? Closest ever Earth-like planet confirmed by scientists https://t.co/O0tXHSw11Lpic.twitter.com/C8j4YjytqO The next-closest binary system that hosts planets is comprised of two stars that are about 1,000 AU’s apart. Researchers said this kind of system is incredibly rare, and the latest discovery makes it one of only seven ever found. The researchers point out that this system is even more unusual because both stars are “metal poor,” meaning that most of their mass is hydrogen and helium, as opposed to other elements such as iron or oxygen. Usually, stars that host giant planets are \"metal rich.” Researchers say Jupiter’s gravitational pull is likely to have significantly influenced the shape of our solar system as it was forming, and the scarcity of Jupiter-like planets could be key in explaining why our system is different from all the others found to date. The findings, which may help explain the influence that giant planets have over a solar system’s architecture, have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Johanna Teske, who led the research, explained: “We are trying to figure out if giant planets like Jupiter often have long and, or eccentric orbits.” “If this is the case, it would be an important clue to figuring out the process by which our solar system formed, and might help us understand where habitable planets are likely to be found,” she added.

              "  'Writing in Newsweek magazine, Blair said there has never been a stronger need for European unity, on defense and elsewhere, and that the EU must bind together and ignore those who are “forever looking backward to break the union asunder.” Blair said the rise of China and India as major global powers meant the balance of global power may shift. If Britain wished to stay relevant, he argued, it must remain bound to Europe. He said smaller countries which have population of below 100 million would be wise to rely on their “geographical relationships” to stay ahead of the game and a major part if this involves a pan-European defense force. “I would argue that in the medium term, there will be a growing requirement for Europe to build defense capability. “That force would not supplant NATO but would have the independent ability to take military action at times when Europe’s security interests are threatened when the US may decide not to be involved,” he said. Euroskeptics were quick to fire back at Blair. “If you look at other parts of the EU, they soon become bloated, unwieldy and heavily bureaucratic institutions and I have little doubt that an EU army would go the same way,” UK Independence Party (UKIP) defense spokesman Mike Hookem told the Express newspaper. Tony Blair, who is hugely responsible for so much death and chaos with his warmongering, calls for an EU army. Typical! Hookem also took a swipe at Blair’s arguably checkered record on military strategy. “At the moment we are still waiting for the results of the multimillion-pound Chilcot inquiry that has taken years to produce. “Until its release I would advise Mr. Blair to keep his own council on military matters,” he said.

Dan Glazebrook: You have to look at the recent history of US militarism and NATO aggression. NATO deeply invested in regime change operations by proxy, several of which have not gone very well, for example, in Syria and Ukraine. NATO has failed to ensure its new kind of regime change operations have been successful…It doesn’t want to see them fail and one of the reasons that they have been failing is because of Russia’s refusal to simply roll over and let the US create one failed state after another. So, Russia is deeply despised by many elements within the US military establishment for being a thorn in the side of the US regime change juggernaut. We have to understand that the NATO countries and the US are already leading an economic war against Russia through sanctions, through its policy to encourage Saudi to cause a debt in the oil price. This hasn’t worked. And this is resorting to outright militarism and this is part of it. And we have seen NATO member Turkey attacking and shooting down a Russian jet and we’ve seen in the last few weeks Turkey and Saudi Arabia opening an invasion of Syria…This is part of the ongoing attempts to show the world that the US is ready, able and willing to fight a world war - potentially with Russia.\\xa0 Not just to fight against Syria or Libya, but actually to risk world war against Russia to defend its right to conduct illegal regime change, to create failed states and to turn peaceful countries into sectarian bloodbaths. That is what this is all about. RT: The war games include an aggressor part and a defender part. Do you think there is a strategic undertone or it’s just a way for NATO to demonstrate its military power? DG: There are strategic elements. There is going to be strategic resource wars in the Arctic and they are preparing for that... Remember the US strategy of full-spectrum dominance announced after the end of the Cold war: the idea that there should be no inch of the planet really that is beyond US military control…But I still think first and foremost they need to convince the world, demonstrate to the world that they are willing to go to war with Russia. Because it may be a bluff, but they need to convince the world that this is not a bluff and that they are able to do that. And for sure there are elements in the US military establishment [who] would be willing to do that, and that is not a bluff. So, it is a very dangerous situation that we are seeing develop here. RT: NATO says that there are no grounds for Russia to consider these drills and the whole NATO activity in the region as a threat. Do you think these claims are true? DG: These countries often have this kind of analysis, but have mater on its head. Who’s going around the world creating failed states. If we look at Russia’s actions, they have been defensive and as much as they’ve been trying to defend, for example, in Ukraine, and actually quite minimal involvement of Russia in Ukraine, but to the extent they have been involved to try and defend the people of eastern Ukraine from the onslaught of neo-Nazi forces that have been unleashed on them by an illegal regime change operation backed by the US. In Syria they have been invited by the Syrian government to prevent a collapse of the Syrian government in the face of a sectarian death squad onslaught sponsored by the US and Britain and others.\\xa0 To try and characterize this as Russian aggression when actually they are just conducting some level of defense against illegal aggression that has been going on around the world led by the US, this is completely puts the matter on its head. It’s an observable, empirical fact that NATO is surrounding and encircling Russia with troops, threatening Russia with this kind of exercises. We also know from past experience that NATO countries’ leaders are not to be believed when they reassure Russia. For example, when George Bush Sr said that NATO won’t advance one inch to the East, and every country that has joined the EU to the East had subsequently gone on to join NATO. NATO assurances are not worth the paper they are written on. It doesn’t matter what NATO is saying, it is what they are doing that gives their game away.

Gen. Yahya Rasool said in a statement cited by AP. Most of the bodies have been reduced to skeletons. Due to the decaying process of the bodies as well as their clothes it’ is hard to establish whether these were soldiers or civilians, Rasool added. A forensics team from Baghdad is set to investigate the site and carry out tests on the bodies. Islamic State terrorists and all those involved in the atrocities in Mosul should be hold responsible, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said following the news about the latest mass grave. “The only thing we can do is condemn these atrocities. We hope that the military operation will be over soon and that it would go in accordance with international law, human rights and international humanitarian law so that people could get their lives back to normal. There is no doubt that those who commit these inhuman crimes should be held accountable,” Dujarric said, adding that the UN is highly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Mosul. In June, Iraqi troops found another mass grave with the remains of nearly 400 people by the city of Fallujah while leading an operation against IS. Most of the victims there were executed in 2014 and 2015 with a shot in the head. Mosul, the IS stronghold in Iraq, is under siege by several forces, including the Iraqi army, its allies from the Shiite militias, Kurdish militias, and a Turkish expeditionary force in Iraq. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the joint offensive. The current events resemble a “medieval slaughter” as the population is being killed by both IS terrorists and the US-led coalition conducting operations in Mosul, according to spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sunday that 34,000 Iraqis had left their homes since the start of the operation, adding that most of those people were put in temporary shelters. However, over 1 million civilians are believed to remain trapped in Mosul as the terrorists kill anybody who attempts to flee. While the offensive in Iraq’s second most populous has not yet entered the intensive urban warfare phase, international humanitarian organizations have voiced concern that the hostilities will take a significant toll on the civilian population.

He has also promised the Vatican, which has condemned the “barbaric killing,” that all measures possible would be taken to protect religious sites in the country, le Figaro reported.\\xa0 \\xa0Yet, Hollande’s Socialist government is coming under increasing criticism, as other politicians claim its response has failed to provide security for French people in their own country.“After the Nice attack, our country is once again hit by barbarity in particularly inhuman circumstances...This situation has to finally lead us to greater understanding that we have to deeply change the dimension, the measures, the strategy of our response,” former French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at a Tuesday press conference in Paris. Sarkozy urges 'ruthless' French response to #SaintEtienneDuRouvray attack https://t.co/lliZgrzFeMpic.twitter.com/kOiHK9Q5DZ Saying that the “assassination” of a Catholic priest in a church has “affected France’s soul,” the politician stated that this kind of “enemy has no taboo, no limit, no morals, no borders.”“We must be merciless,” Sarkozy, who is expected to run for the French presidency next year, said, adding “There is no more time to be wasted. This is war and there is no other choice than to fight it.”  Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Front party, has blamed the church attack not only on Islamists, but also on those “who have governed this country over the past 30 years,” saying they bear “huge” responsibility for the current events.Philippe de Villers, a former two-time French presidential candidate and leader of the Movement for France (MPF), a conservative party, told RT that the attackers’ choice of target was significant “and represents something completely new.”“Before they used to attack the police, passers-by or those on holiday – now they are targeting those who are religious,” he said, while also saying the country’s “soul” had been affected. “France was cut to the heart, its soul is weeping,” he said, adding that the attack “marked a new stage” in terrorism and that a response must now be “immediate.” “France’s borders should be restored, the flow of migrants stopped and [those who are already in the country] must be made to respect the principle of assimilation – either you love France, or leave,” he told RT.Eric Ciotti, a member of the French National Assembly from the Republicans party, has also proposed extreme measures, saying that “France must immediately expel all foreign radicals.” La France doit expulser immédiatement tous les étrangers radicalisés #SaintEtienneDuRouvray 3/4 Other politicians expressed concern over the precedence punishing measures take over precautionary ones. A former interior ministry official, Yvan Blot, told RT he believes France needs to upgrade its intelligence services, saying that “only the secret services are efficient,” while also accusing the government of not taking the threat posed by Islamic extremists seriously. “It is not very efficient to display lots of police or soldiers on the street. Naturally this is good for the morale of the local population, but efficiency comes only from the secret services,” he said. Jerome Lambert, a National Assembly deputy from the Socialist Party, agreed that ramping up police presence will not solve the problem. “It is simply not possible to place a policeman by each church. There may be some 40,000 churches in the country, and 100,000 police officers,” he said, adding that tougher precautionary measures are needed to prevent terrorists from causing further harm.The politician pointed out that at least one of the assailants that forced the priest to kneel before slitting his throat lived in the same commune, meaning he had “attacked people who he lived next to.” He went on to say that Islamic State’s tactics had evolved, expanding “terrorism to everywhere, and not just to big cities and large symbolic centers.” \"],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The US president arrived in London for a three-day visit on April 22. Obama underlined the importance of the UK staying in the EU in his comments after a meeting Friday with UK Prime Minister David Cameron. RT: President Obama arrived in the UK to \"wish Her Majesty the Queen a happy birthday in person\" but is that the only reason why Obama has decided to make the trip across the Atlantic? Katie Hopkins, columnist for MailOnline: I think overall the sense here and certainly the sense that I am getting from people is there is really a question about interference. Why have we got an American coming over here to the UK to tell us how to vote on the EU, why is he splashed across the front of our newspapers telling us that he has a right to have a say because American blood was spilt helping defend us in WWII and why have we got him telling us that it is good for us to stay as a part of Europe because it is good for lawmaking, it is good for our financial systems and it is good for our sovereignty – whereas in fact we have given away our sovereignty: we don’t have controls over our own laws here in the UK. And we certainly don’t have any control over our borders. I think, people like me who want to vote to get out of Europe – we don’t actually want Obama over here. I’d rather see someone like Donald Trump come over because at least he has a firm line on immigration. RT: Stephen, Barack Obama is pretty much asking the UK to sacrifice its sovereignty. Should he be getting a vote in the first place here anyway? Stephen Haseler, Director, the Global Policy Institute: Of course, he should. He is our major ally. They defended us in the Cold War. American blood has been spilt in Europe in defending Britain. And anyway, why do want to treat our major ally in such an offhanded manner? It seems that all these folks in this country, sort of bitter types, who are opposing American president even giving advice to us. I think they’ve now succeeded in annoying the Americans, annoying the Europeans and they are basically a bunch of Little Englanders who are not big enough to take advice. It is only advice, there is no interference and American president and Americans don’t have a vote in this. We have a vote in it. But surely we can take advice from people like the president. Take advice from anybody who wants to give it to us. Let’s be grown up about this. RT: Katie, President Obama outlined why he believes Britain should stay in the EU: he cites new jobs, trade, economic growth and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. These are all valid points, aren\\'t they? KH: I don’t know if there are valid points, actually. I don’t think it is about the idea that we are Little Britain and we are not prepared to take advice. I am certainly prepared to take advice, I’ve listened to people saying Europe is bankrupt, I’ve listened to the head of the European Commission saying: “We do interfere too much.” I’ve just listened to advice from those controlling migration saying actually 150 people a day are now arriving again into Greece and into Italy… I’ve listened to people telling us that actually we are infiltrated by Al-Qaeda here in the UK. And the threat of terror at the moment remains severe. And I don’t buy into any of the arguments why staying in Europe is a good idea when we can’t control our borders, the threat of terror is severe and we are giving over 350 million pounds a day to an institution when our own NHS is bankrupt. And also why would I take advice from Obama when he has doubled the deficit in his own country during his shocking administration?

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'The story was initially reported\\xa0by the local Berlin Morgenpost newspaper, before receiving wider coverage in the German media.\\xa0 According to the outlet, a group of seven boys “encircled” and sexually harassed three sisters, aged nine, 11 and 14, at a swimming pool in Berlin’s Mariendorf district. Police said that one of the alleged perpetrators was aged 14, while the others ranged between seven and 11 years old. Six of the boys have been identified as Syrian, although the nationality of the other member of the group could not be established, officials said. “Five of the boys grabbed the girls by their breasts and bottoms,” the father of the three girls is quoted as saying by the Berlin Morgen Post. The man took his daughters and their female friend to the swimming pool at around 9am local time on Monday to celebrate a birthday. While the minors were playing in the water, they were reportedly surrounded by the group of seven boys. One of the girls then managed to alert a pool employee, who immediately called the police. \"The suspects are said to have followed the girls and touched them,” law enforcers said in comments on the case. Following the incident, all of the boys were detained and taken to a police station for questioning, but were later handed over to their parents. The authorities are now investigating the male youngsters for “assault on sexual grounds,” Focus reports, citing police. Pool officials have also reacted to the attack, banning all seven boys from entering the facility for one year. Sexual harassment of minors at German recreation facilities was repeatedly in the spotlight earlier this year. In one case, a 27-year-old migrant was arrested for a sexual attack on two nine-year-old girls at a swimming pool in the town of Rendsburg in April. Back then, the girls told police that they were inappropriately touched by two foreigners at the local swimming pool. However, law enforcers managed to detain only one of the attackers – a 27-year-old Iraqi man. Similar cases have also been reported from Austria. Earlier this week an Iraqi refugee who raped a 10-year-old boy at a Vienna swimming pool in December 2015 saw his conviction overturned due to a “formal mistake.” '],\n",

              "  'The simple test, developed by researchers at King’s College London, takes 45 minutes and gauges children’s intelligence, language and motor skills, as well as their levels of tolerance, restlessness, impulsivity and social disadvantage. Three-year-olds who score the lowest results are more likely to receive criminal convictions or end up relying on welfare benefits. Scientists followed 1,000 children from before they started school until they were adults aged 38, to see if it was possible to predict who would end up having a troubled life. Forcing children to attend Christian school assemblies undermines human rights - UN https://t.co/FeboRuMDFQpic.twitter.com/9IrPb4TP4R After 35 years, researchers found 20 percent of the 1,000 children became a much greater drain on society than the other 80 percent. One fifth of the group was responsible for 81 percent of the criminal convictions, three quarters of drug prescriptions, two thirds of welfare benefits payments and more than half of nights in hospital. This finding confirmed to researchers that the ‘Pareto principle’ – which states that for many events, 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes – can also be applied to human behavior. “About 20 percent of the population is using the lion’s share of a wide array of public services,” said Professor Terrie Moffitt of King’s College and Duke University in North Carolina. “The same people use most of the NHS (National Health Service), the criminal courts, insurance claims for disabling injury, pharmaceutical prescriptions and special welfare benefits.” Police break up mass children’s brawl in southeast London https://t.co/0KYMVviETYpic.twitter.com/EK5QkNPY4I Researchers also learned this outcome can be predicted simply by looking at how well the participants scored on the test they were given at age three. They hope to use the test to determine who is at greater risk, so that interventions can be made to prevent them becoming a burden on society. Moffitt said it is easy to think of these people as “lazy bums who are freeloading off the taxpayer and exploiting the public purse.” “But we also went further back into their childhood and found that 20 percent begin their lives with mild problems with brain function and brain health when they were very small children. Looking at health examinations really changed the whole picture. It gives you a feeling of compassion for these people as opposed to a feeling of blame. “Being able to predict which children will struggle is an opportunity to intervene in their lives very early to attempt to change their trajectories for everyone’s benefit, and could bring big returns on investment for government.” '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"In an exclusive short interview on the sidelines of St. Petersburg International Culture Forum, the Oscar-nominated actor said the event had been a “chance for artists to get together and discuss what they do, understand each other and talk about how we make films, the challenge of making films.” Apart from this opportunity to exchange ideas with fellow cinema industry professionals, Fiennes’s incentive to come to Russia’s northern capital also stems from a desire of “being part of theater or cinema that is connected to Russia.” “Of, course, as you know I have a strong interest in being part of theater or cinema that is connected to Russia, so I come with this specific interest,” he told RT. While UK-Russia bilateral relations are not at their highest, at least, this does not prevent intense artistic exchange between the two countries as people feel connection on the cultural level regardless of political tension, Fiennes said. “Well, already, the great theater director Declan Donnellan for many years has been creating fantastic productions in Moscow with Russian actors and I know the Russian theater that often comes to London,” he said, citing an example of such an exchange, adding that he is “happy [the theater] continues to do so.” “Whatever happens politically, in terms of our culture and our understanding through music, drama, painting we have a deep connection,” he concluded. Ralph Fiennes is best known for his performance as Nazi war criminal Amon Göth in Schindler's List, which garnered him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well as in The English Patient, The Avengers and other word-famous productions. The Harry Potter saga fans, however, know him as Lord Voldemort. The fifth St. Petersburg International Culture Forum, which serves an international platform for open dialog and exchange of opinion between experts in culture and cultural policy, is being held from December 1-3. The forum has been organized by the Russian government, the St. Petersburg authorities and endorsed by the Russian Culture Ministry. The extensive program of the forum has been divided into 14 sections, each devoted to one specific cultural field, such as cinema, theater, music, tourism, literature, mass communications, cultural heritage preservation, creative industry and urban science. The number of IMAX theaters in Russia has surpassed that in the UK and trails only China and US, IMAX Senior Vice President John Schreiner told RT speaking at the sidelines of the forum, which this time marks the last month of the Russia’s Year of Film. “Russia is the No. 3 market for us in terms of number of theaters,” Schreiner said, adding that three new IMAX theaters – in Irkutsk, Lipetsk and Tula – will be opened in the coming week. IMAX expansion in Russia has been going at a tremendous pace lately and while it may not be the case anymore, Shreiner hopes the trend will be upward despite the economic problems the company had to deal with in Russia after the ruble plunged against the dollar two years ago. “We expected it continue to grow maybe not as a breakneck pace as we had in the last few years but at the regular pace, about five or six new IMAX theaters in Russia,” Shreiner said. IMAX has been hugely investing in developing new sort “out-of-home entertainment” technologies. Last year the company finished its largest R&D program to date, a laser projection technology, as well as invested in virtual reality. “To support Russia’s Year of Film, IMAX has stepped up its work with Russian home-grown directors and producers like Alexander Rodnyansky, Fedor Bondarchuk and Leonard Vereschagin,” Shreiner noted, saying that the company has remastered them in IMAX format to bring to new viewers abroad, including to China. \"],\n",

              "  '“There have been many reports of incidents on the border. We collected information on this as early as 2014, when we received many reports of people being shot when they were trying to cross the border irregularly,” Gardner said. He added that the current situation in war-torn Syria has led to a spike in the number of migrants being assaulted by Turkish border guards. “Now, the information we received via Syria doctors is that there are reports of two or three people being shot every day trying to cross the border irregularly,” he said. The researcher also stated that the plight of refugees in Syria has driven many of them into the “hands of smugglers,” or forced them to cross the border at night. According to Gardner, Turkish guards fire shots at refugees based on what they say are safety measures. “What the Turkish parties have told us is that they don’t know who these people are, that people could be members of armed groups, they could be smugglers,” he said. Gardner added that the only way to resolve the problem of the migrant flow was to make legal crossing points for refugees on the border with Turkey, and said Ankara “should not have to hold the responsibility for hosting refugees alone.” To alleviate the issue, the researcher urged EU members to accept bigger migrant quotas and advised Russia to accept more refugees from neighboring countries. Late on Monday, Turkey and the EU struck a “game-changing” deal on resolving the refugee crisis in Europe. EU leaders agreed in principle to an Ankara-proposed plan to deport illegal migrants from Greece to Turkey while resettling the same number of Syrian refugees in the EU. In return, EU leaders promised Ankara an additional €3 billion (US$3.3 billion), hinting that further funding, as well as a speedy decision on a visa-free regime, could be expected. Ankara was reminded, however, that it would have to observe all 72 requirements to enjoy such a regime. Turkey has stepped up its border security amid pressure from the US, following the November terror attacks in Paris. The US urged Ankara to close its border with Syria to halt the number of fighters seeking to join terrorist groups fighting there. Damascus has accused Ankara of facilitating the cross-border movement of jihadists, while Moscow has directly accused the family of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of backing the illegal oil trade with Islamic State (IS, ISIS/ISIL) that involves Syrian and Iraqi oil being smuggling across the Turkish border. Turkey is said to be hosting more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees. '],\n",

He was extremely tired and admits to falling asleep at the wheel, according to KFOX. \\'Quiet hero\\': Photo of cop feeding baby after mom’s seizure melts hearts online http://t.co/pRDz8Unmbypic.twitter.com/QZgPvQcNoK “I stopped at the Circle K just up the street. I don\\'t remember what I put. To this day, I don\\'t remember what I put. I had to check my bank account,” Ortega told KFOX. Ortega doesn\\'t remember anything after that except waking up at University Medical Center. But he does take issue with police accounts of the incident, so he turned to local media for an interview and investigation. “I had some bruises on my face and I could feel it when making [facial] gestures,” Ortega said, but he and his family are sure his worst injuries aren’t a result of a car accident. There were also bruises on Ortega’s arms, legs, feet, and back, broken bones in one hand and two fingers, along with two Taser lacerations on his stomach, according to medical records. Additionally, records say Ortega had a grand mal seizure while in his car. That explains certain details in the police report, Ortega and his mother say. The police accident report describes officers responding at 12:45 a.m. to Ortega doing \"donuts,\" or spinning his car until it rammed a rock wall. During or immediately after that moment is when Ortega is believed to have suffered a seizure, which police allegedly unknowingly witnessed. “When he comes out of [a seizure], that\\'s when he\\'s like walking around like in a state of confusion,” Olaya Calanche, Ortega’s mother, told KFOX. “I\\'ve talked to him and I\\'ll be like ‘Junior, Junior, it\\'s Mom.’ He’ll look at me but like he looks past me.\" Police assumed Ortega was drunk, charging him with DUI despite a hospital toxicology report showing no drugs or alcohol in his system. About a week later, the district attorney dropped that charge. However, Ortega still faces charges of resisting arrest, evading arrest, and interfering with public duties. He is now trying to find a lawyer. With police withholding some information pending their internal investigation, Calanche relied on a nurse from the hospital for more details. The nurse spoke with the paramedics who treated her son in an ambulance accompanied by a police officer. The nurse, according to Calanche, was told by paramedics that “my son had become very combative and he had become so strong like the Incredible Hulk that they had to [Taser] him twice and used a baton and some of the bruises were because of the baton.” The first of three arresting affidavits described Ortega “looking around aimlessly” and that he “appeared disoriented,” saying he needed to leave. Ortega began walking away from the responding officer, and that’s when the first arrest attempt was made. The affidavit continues, saying Ortega grabbed the officer by \"his arms and forced him to the ground,\" before Ortega wrestled out of that and the officer pinned him against the rock wall. Still trying to apply the handcuffs, the officer called for backup, then used his Taser three times, at which point the wires tangled and the officer switched to his baton. While the second affidavit concurs with the first, saying three officers were needed to take control of Ortega, the third affidavit actually doubled that figure, claiming six officers were required. The affidavits allege Ortega was “tensing his arms, thrashing his legs and twisting his body,”\\xa0but that wasn’t a sign of resistance, according to Ortega’s physician, KFOX reported. Neverclear: Student gets stuck on tracks, wrestles cops after drinking high-proof alcohol https://t.co/lQH0JE9M7gpic.twitter.com/z7tzwQlcTm “If a person does not know what a seizure is, they will not know this is a seizure,” said Dr. Darine Kassar, a neurologist at Texas Tech University Health Science Center. After the seizure, the person goes into what is called a \"postictal phase,\" which can last minutes or hours. “They will not know what happened, they will be confused, they will be disoriented,” Kassar said. “They can be combative, they can be not following commands, because they are confused. They are not back to their normal baseline.” In this situation, “don\\'t try to restrain them or be aggressive with them,” Kassar said, “because they are still not back to their normal selves.” Kassar also clarified that Ortega was driving because he had been seizure-free for over six months and was regularly taking his medication. Texas law requires a person have no seizures for three months before being able to drive legally. Not only was Ortega constrained and beaten, he was left face down when fire officials and paramedics arrived, a position that “can obstruct breathing and cause death,” according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Paramedics treated Ortega as a level one trauma, the most severe, KFOX reported, and Ortega was still having seizures and maintaining a postictal phase on the way to the hospital.

I\\'ll get pulled over and talk very courteously to any cop. I have cop friends.” Ortega turned himself in after being released from the hospital, but it was his injuries that kept him off of work for a month. That, Ortega fears, could be only the beginning of the consequences he will face if he is unable to get a good enough lawyer to defend himself in court. “What I am worried about is it might not work. I might still get this, I might not have enough evidence and the judge will return it and say, ‘Hey, you\\'re going to have this on your record.’ That\\'s what worries me,” Ortega told KFOX. The El Paso Police Department says it instructs its recruits on medical emergencies and how to recognize seizures during the academy training. '],\n",

Apart from possible re-deployment of nuclear deterrence to the Korean peninsula, Washington is discussing the stationing of the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) advanced missile defense system with Seoul, a move strongly opposed by Beijing, which sees deployment of the complex as proliferation of US military presence in the region.

She told reporters that she learned this from Viktor Bout himself and also from his American lawyers. The latter told her in a private conversation that if her husband had agreed to testify against Sechin, he could have gotten off with about two years behind bars and, after serving them, the authorities promised that he “could live in the United States in comfort together with his wife and daughter.”“Viktor honestly said that he never worked for Sechin and did not know him personally; he refused the offer and got 25 years in prison for crimes he was charged with,” she added. Alla Bout stressed that, as far as she knew, her husband really did not know Sechin. “They have never even met, even once,” she said. READ MORE: Appeal rejection by US court confirms Viktor Bout’s case is political – Russian diplomat Viktor Bout used to be a businessman specializing in air cargo. He was arrested in Thailand in 2008 in a sting operation conducted by US agents posing as guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) – a group the United States considers a terrorist organization. The agents allegedly asked Bout if it was possible for members of a foreign terrorist group to purchase anti-aircraft weapons, and he reportedly answered that it could be possible, in theory, but without ever offering to provide them. This admission of theoretical possibility was apparently sufficient for the United States to extradite Bout to the United States in 2010, however, and a year later he was convicted of being involved in a conspiracy to kill US citizens. He pleaded not guilty in court and continues to insist on his innocence. Russia has repeatedly blasted Bout’s extradition and sentence as a politically motivated violation of international law and an example of the bias of the US justice system. In a 2016 interview with the New York Times, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin admitted that the charges brought against Bout were excessive and inappropriate. “I’m not defending him,” Scheindlin said, “but he’s a businessman. He was in the business of selling arms.” He was not, she added, a fighter or a terrorist from Al Qaeda “who lives to blow up civilians in a supermarket.” READ MORE: 25-yr US sentence for Russian 'Lord of War' Viktor Bout inappropriate – judge Currently the CEO of Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin is considered to be a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he worked as deputy prime minister in the Russian government and, before that, worked in the presidential administration and the administration of Russia’s second-largest city, St. Petersburg, which was called Leningrad in Soviet times. The only apparent connection between Sechin and Bout concerns their respective military service in the Soviet Army. Sechin was reportedly stationed in Angola as an interpreter in mid-1980s, first with a Navy unit and then in an anti-aircraft unit. Bout also served as a radio operator and interpreter in the Soviet Air Force and participated in missions in Angola, but this was after 1989, and Sechin officially started working in the Leningrad city legislature in 1988. \"],\n",

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  'The statue of Orwell – real name Eric Blair – will be accompanied by a plaque that reads: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear,” the Guardian reported on Monday. Sculptor Martin Jennings told the Guardian: “I was delighted when I visited the site to find it littered with cigarette butts – that is absolutely the place for Orwell, who was rarely seen without a cigarette in hand, to the grave detriment of his health.” “He would undoubtedly have been out there in the cold with the smokers for most of his time,” Jennings added. ‘1984’, perhaps Orwell’s most famous work, tells the story of an unfortunate everyman making his way through a fictional authoritarian Britain locked in an everlasting war against an indistinct enemy. In the dystopian scenario, civil liberties are eliminated and the citizenry constantly watched as they are fed lies by a shadowy government organization called the Ministry of Truth. Plans to erect a statue to Orwell were dropped in 2012, allegedly because the Spanish Civil War veteran was viewed as being too left-wing. For one reason or another, the plan has been revived. Orwell himself was once employed by the BBC as a producer on the organization’s Eastern Service. The terrifying torture chamber depicted in ‘1984’ – Room 101 – was even named after a stuffy conference room in the BBC HQ to which Orwell apparently took a severe dislike. In his 1943 resignation letter, available in the BBC’s online archives, Orwell attacks the corporation’s tendency to broadcast “hopeless” propaganda on India. It was later found that the kind of radio sets the BBC broadcasted for were not widely in use in India, and that the signal was so weak it would have been unintelligible anyway. The campaign for a statue of the man, who many consider the father of political journalism, was launched by the late Labour MP Ben Whittaker. His widow Janet told the Metro newspaper on Monday: “Orwell’s resonance is international. Wherever powerful governments falsify events, suppress freedom of information or dehumanize their processes, people recognize the satire in 1984.” '],\n",

They found that the sulfate level was 100 to 1,000 times less than what would be expected in the water supply, suggesting that low levels of microbes are already existing in the water and using up the chemical to survive. “The wow factor is high,” Long Li, study author and an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, said in a statement. Researchers led by #UofT\\'s Barbara Sherwood Lollar find mysterious signs of life in ancient water https://t.co/jdRpgpanlz While this doesn’t definitively prove microbes are living in the water, the researchers are excited about the possibility that microbial communities have been evolving there for millions of years without either sunlight or atmospheric oxygen. \"This continues to open up our idea of how much of this planet is habitable,\" Barbara Sherwood Lollar, one of the researchers from the University of Toronto, told The Globe and Mail.\\xa0\"And it speaks to the habitability of Mars as well.\" The surface of Mars is covered with billion-year-old rocks, and some areas of the Red Planet boast a similar mineral composition to that tested in northern Ontario.\\xa0 “Because this is a fairly common geological setting in early Earth as well as modern Mars, we think that as long as the right minerals and water are present, likely kilometers below the surface, they can produce the necessary energy source to support the microbes. I’m not saying that these microbes definitively exist, but the conditions are right to support microbial life on Mars,” Li said. Researchers in South Africa had previously found microbes living in ancient water in the cracks of rocks, however the Canadian water has been isolated for 10 times longer than the South African samples. Li, whose team is now working with microbiologists to establish any traces of life in the water, says the best bet of finding life on Mars is to look beneath the surface. via GIPHY The findings have also sparked excitement in scientific circles beyond those directly involved in the research. Alex Sessions, professor of geobiology at Caltech, told the Globe and Mail that the development was significant. “The thing that’s special is that the sulfate is being generated by radioactive decay,” Sessions explained. “It means that on countless planets, moons or asteroids that lack oceans, volcanoes and deep sea vents – all of which help support ecosystems on Earth – alien life may be surviving on little more than water, sulfur and radioactive elements.” '],\n",

              "  \"Working in accordance with the New START treaty between Russia and US, the country’s leading Zvezdochka shipyard in the northern Russian city of Severodvinsk will disarm the missile system of the Arkhangelsk submarine, the shipyard’s press service told TASS news agency on Friday. “We will remove the covers of the submarine’s missile launchers and seal them, thus making it impossible to use the vessel’s missile weapons,” the press service said. “We are not talking yet about dismantling the submarine itself. The tender for this procedure has not yet been announced.” According to the data published by the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom, the sub’s disarmament is estimated to cost some 28 million rubles (about US$ 400,000). The nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine Arkhangelsk TK-17 was designed in 1987 under the Project 941 ‘Shark’ (or ‘Typhoon’ according to NATO classification). The project was aimed to equip the Soviet Navy with nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and resulted in the creation of the largest class of submarines ever built – large enough to accommodate decent living facilities for the crew of 179 when submerged for months on end, and to stock an arsenal of 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Three of the six Typhoon-class submarines built in the 1980s have already been dismantled at the shipyards in Severodvinsk. Of the three that remain, Arkhangelsk and Severstal are set to be dismantled. Dmitri Donskoi just recently underwent a modernization procedure and is now equipped to test the latest sea-based missile system Bulava. The New START treaty (on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms), which was designed to reduce American and Russian nuclear stockpiles, came into force in 2011. It replaced the previous 1991 agreement, introducing lower ceilings for the numbers of warheads and delivery systems deployed. Commenting on the progress made on the treaty’s fifth anniversary in February, US Secretary of State John Kerry complimented both sides on successful cooperation in the field. “[New START treaty] continues to be an area of cooperation and continued dialogue between the United States and Russia. I share President Obama's strong belief that our two countries, which ushered in the era of nuclear arms, have a special responsibility to lead the world beyond it,”\\xa0he said in a statement.\\xa0 However, the latest moves by the US – such as plans to upgrade 180 B61s strategic bombs stocked in European air bases to a modernized B61-12 version – have raised doubts whether the US adheres to the nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Opponents of the program have argued that instead of scaling down atomic weapons stockpiles in accordance with the NPT, the overhaul is actually creating more states hosting modern nuclear weapons – a provocation that theoretically weakens Russia’s deterrent. Moscow keeps the presence of American nuclear weapons in Europe in mind when shaping its own military policies. as reflected in Russia’s newest military doctrine published in 2014, spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova told German television last year. “The comprehensive analysis of the situation points to the threat posed by the increasing military capability of NATO and its endowment with global functions, which it performs in violation of the international law, as well as the encroachment of the military infrastructure of NATO members on the borders of the Russian Federation,” she said.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  '“There should be no obstacles to accessing knowledge, I believe,” she told RT in an email interview, echoing her earlier reference to Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: that “everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.” Whether you’re a young Master’s student, an ambitious postdoctoral researcher or a seasoned professor, you rely on other people’s research to supplement your own as a lifeline. But it has become so that while the scientists writing the papers are paid next to nothing, they are essentially faced with a middleman in the form of money-hoarding online publishers – academic hubs where all that research resides, sometimes costing $30 per paper to download. Now, imagine having to download at least 10-20 such papers – and that is for a scarcely popular topic. Researchers may have to go through dozens for other ones. Elbakyan, a Russian neuroscientist from Kazakhstan, was among the many victims of this academic capitalist monopoly on knowledge. Writing her thesis on the lesser-researched areas of biometric scanning for consumer electronics, she was faced with $300 at the very least for papers she would probably never again have to read. “For me, even the purchase of one such article would be a financial setback,” Alexandra told RT in an email. “So I had to go about acquiring all the articles by pirate means.” A year or two after 2009, when Alexandra took part in a large online forum on molecular biology, she was introduced to Fulltext – a hub where researchers could file requests for academic papers to help with research. Already an expert coder, it did not take Alexandra long to write her own, improved script a year later. Called Sci-Hub, it circumvents university server security using access keys provided by sympathetic researchers with online resource access at those universities. Every time there was a search, Sci-Hub would locate the work, and it was on its servers forever. Now the portal boasts close to 50 million papers and growing. If before, it was a mere search and extraction tool, it now automatically searches for missing articles on important topics, and downloads them to its database. “In the end the system got to its feet and started self-adding up to a million articles each month,” Alexandra says. Akin to an anonymizer website, it looks for the link and, using university proxies, sends it back to the student unlocked. “That the original anonymizer codes were open-source was a huge blessing. But university proxies function slightly differently, so I had to alter the source code,” Alexandra says. “The entire development, including testing, took only about three days,” she says. “I was surprised myself that the thing actually worked and people were using it… the ‘thank you’ button was clicked 316 times as soon as the service was announced.” Other scientists on the microbiology forum became the site’s first users. There were one or two other portals dealing with such requests, (Library Genesis, or Lib-Gen, remains the only one similar to Sci-Hub), but with only 100 requests per day at the start, Sci-Hub now gets anywhere from one to several thousand. Having undergone some minor and major rewrites over the four years, Alexandra’s website really is the best viable alternative to paid sources today. Unsurprisingly, this quickly increased its capacity for interfering with huge payoffs enjoyed by science publishers – sources that basically make scientists buy back their work. This infamy led to popular scientific publisher Elsevier filing a lawsuit, which was successful late last year in getting a temporary injunction against Sci-Hub’s activities. This was after in 2012, a large community of scientists boycotted it; so much so that even Harvard University complained it didn’t have enough funds to keep paying Elsevier. The publisher estimated its losses to be in the area of $75,000-150,000, court records stated. It now wants this figure paid out for each and every pirated article. There are hundreds of thousands. Its reasoning is that monetizing access to academic knowledge helps bring in funding for academic research. But Elbakyan and others say most study authors don’t actually get paid for published work – and that is why Sci-Hub is so different from some illegal music or movie download service. Currently, Elbakayn says she’s been served with a temporary injunction. It could still go either way for Sci-Hub, but it is unlikely that a US court would rule in favor of free information, she believes. READ MORE: Climate change helps slow, not quicken, rising sea levels – NASA Either way, American courts can’t really cause much more damage to Sci-Hub than ruling in Elsevier’s favor. Firstly, because Sci-Hub servers are outside the US, in Russia. The New York district court can’t prosecute Elbakyan, because she has no US assets; secondly, because an ever-growing body of scientists actually support the initiative and increasingly turn against the capitalizing publishers; and third – because even if someone tried to target Sci-Hub, they couldn’t: its servers have moved to the dark net– that concealed corner of the internet normally reserved for buying drugs, ordering hits on people or trading in child pornography. “Even if legal access to [Sci-Hub] is blocked, the user can still get in through the TOR network and immediately gain access to all the articles. However, we intent to fight for free access to all information. After all, using TOR still provides obstacles. And I believe there should be no obstacles on the way to scientific knowledge.” After Elsevier’s court victory last year, many scientists who had already previously boycotted the publisher wrote an open letter in support of Sci-Hub and the Netherlands-based Library Genesis. “There are many businessmen who own knowledge today. Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose 37 percent profit margin stands in sharp contrast to the rising fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages for the adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest databases of academic material, which are licensed at prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest university of the global north, has complained that it cannot afford them any longer,” it writes. The scientists called Elsevier’s lawsuit “a big blow” and described how online forums, IRC channels and chatrooms “have been filled with [academics’] distress messages, desperately seeking articles and publications.” But Elbakyan herself refuses to give up, despite the mounting risks of picking a fight with the establishment. And she says that, as long as such overwhelming support from fellow scientists continues, her idea has a fighting chance. It already appears to be changing the entire approach to knowledge-gathering and challenging the capitalistic greed that seeks to privatize it. '],\n",

              "  'The new files published by the Intercept\\xa0partly lay to rest speculation by journalists and campaigners over what really goes on at the US base. They show that secretive NSA kill-capture operations in the Middle East have been developed and initiated from inside the base’s heavily guarded perimeter wire. The programs, which carry names like GHOSTWOLF and GHOSTHUNTER, have been used to support conventional operations in war zones such as Afghanistan and Yemen – with which neither Britain nor the US is officially at war. In July, the Obama administration revealed that somewhere between 64 and 116 civilian casualties were inflicted by US air strikes outside Afghanistan and Iraq in the years 2009 through 2015. While Washington didn’t specify where exactly the deadly strikes took place, they are believed to have been carried out in Yemen, Pakistan and North Africa. But the release of the figures, touted by Obama as a step toward more transparency, was criticized by various human rights organizations as distorting the actual picture. According to various independent assessments, anywhere from 200 up to 1,000 civilians fell victim to the US air campaigns. The leaks also call into question claims about UK complicity in deadly drones strikes carried out using the intelligence base. In the past Britain claims to have full knowledge and have given full consent for what goes on at Menwith Hill, despite claims by campaigners that clandestine US operations may constitute war crimes. The latest revelations have been criticized by human rights groups, including Reprieve. The organization’s top lawyer, Kat Craig, told the Intercept on Tuesday this was “yet another example of the unacceptable level of secrecy that surrounds UK involvement in the US ‘targeted killing’ program.” “It is now imperative that the prime minister comes clean about UK involvement in targeted killing to ensure that British personnel and resources are not implicated in illegal and immoral activities,” Craig said. While the Ministry of Defence (MoD) refused to comment on the release, an approach by the Intercept to the NSA was referred to Director of National Intelligence (DNI). DNI spokesman Richard Kolko told the website: “The men and women serving the intelligence community safeguard US national security by collecting information, conducting analysis, and providing intelligence for informed decision making under a strict set of laws, policies and guidelines. This mission protects our nation and others around the world.” In April 2012, the covert Menwith Hill intelligence center was propelled into the public spotlight after local residents joined by the members of the Occupy movement. Together, they staged mass protests outside the base.\\xa0 \"The UK’s providing a facility here that’s involved in drone attacks that we know, from independent assessments, are killing and injuring thousands of civilians, and because of the covert nature of that warfare, it’s very difficult to provide information and accountability through the UK parliament. And yet these are acts of war,” Dr Steve Schofield, author of the 65-page report \"Lifting the Lid on Menwith\", told RT back then. Matteo Bergamini, founder, director of Shout Out UK platform, believes the UK government should give an explicit account to the public on what is actually going on in the clandestine facility. “Ideally, I would like the authorities to come clean, to say what has happened and essentially put it to the public and actually start to act\\xa0like a democracy,” he told RT, adding that those people who will be found responsible of violating the international law as result of such revelations, should be prosecuted in the UK. However, the chances of this taking place are low, judging by past experience. “I think the reaction of the authorities will be trying to hide it, or trying to scapegoat it on somebody else like they had with the whistleblowers in the past,” Bergamini said.

The post, written by BBC producer Andrew Alexander, is alleged to have said: “Just before 9am we learned from Laura Kuenssberg, who comes on the program every Wednesday ahead of PMQs, that she was speaking to one junior shadow minister who was considering resigning. “I wonder, mused our presenter Andrew Neil, if they would consider doing it live on the show?” The proposition was then put to Kuenssberg, who though it a “great idea.” How the BBC fixed the news on Wednesday. No bias there, then. #bbcdp#LauraKuenssberghttps://t.co/ubihR13lgj “Within the hour we heard that Laura had sealed the deal,” Alexander wrote, adding, “we knew his resignation just before PMQs would be a dramatic moment with big political impact.” This led to accusations that the BBC team, not Doughty, made the choice to air the resignation minutes before PMQs. The BBC denied this amid the subsequent Twitter storm, claiming its actions and coverage had been balanced and impartial.

The row comes as the Media Reform Coalition published figures suggesting Corbyn has been “systematically undermined” by the media. Analyzing almost 500 articles from across the media written in the first week of Corbyn’s leadership, the Coalition’s finding appears to indicate a widespread assault on the veteran socialist. Out of 494 pieces 296 were negative and only 65, or 13 percent, were positive. \"],\n",

The 150-page question-and-answer book coincides with the Jubilee Year of Mercy, during which the world\\'s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics are expected to seek forgiveness and also to forgive. In one of the chapters, Pope Francis admits he has a “special relationship” with people in prison. “Every time I go through the gates into a prison to celebrate Mass or for a visit, I always think: Why them and not me? I should be here. I deserve to be here. Their fall could have been mine,” the pontiff says. “The Church does not exist to condemn people, but to bring about an encounter with the visceral love of God’s mercy,\" he says. “I often say that in order for this to happen, it is necessary to go out: to go out from the churches and the parishes, to go outside and look for people where they live, where they suffer, and where they hope.\" In his new book, Pope Francis, who has called for the Church to extend a helping hand to people on the margins of society, reprimands those in the organization \"who are only used to having things fit into their pre-conceived notions and ritual purity instead of letting themselves be surprised by reality, by a greater love or a higher standard.\" In his first book published as Pope, he says he also wants the Church to show more compassion towards homosexuals. Answering a question about homosexuals, Francis defends his famous old remark \"Who am I to judge?\" saying he was paraphrasing existing Church teaching. \"Before all else comes the individual person, in his wholeness and dignity. And people should not be defined only by their sexual tendencies: let us not forget that God loves all his creatures and we are destined to receive his infinite love,\" he said, according to Reuters. Catholics who divorced and remarried outside the Church and are banned from receiving communion seek mercy too, the pontiff noted. \"We need to enter the darkness, the night in which so many of our brothers live. We need to be able to make contact with them and let them feel our closeness, without letting ourselves be wrapped up in that darkness and be influenced by it,\" Francis said. '],\n",

Jim Jatras: Of course he does. Assad, the Iranians, and the Russians are fighting against ISIS, and Al-Qaeda, and the varieties of jihadists that we insist on calling “moderates” that really are not. RT:\\xa0Does Hillary Clinton have a consistent position on the Middle East based on the e-mails that have been released, the communication and also what she said in the first debate about her policy on Syria? JJ: It’s consistently wrong. She is basically creating a third option, where there isn’t one. She talks about fighting Islamic radicals and of course in the e-mail that was released she knows that our allies, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, are supporting ISIS, Al-Qaeda, all these jihadist groups. She also talks about getting rid of Assad. But who is going to be the third force to take over? There simply isn’t one. There are no moderates capable of taking power. That is what her policy is – it’s nonsensical. RT:\\xa0How revealing are these e-mails about her position and her acknowledgment in communication with staffers in dealing with Saudi Arabia and Qatar? JJ: The first thing that occurred to me – that was August of 2014, over a year after she left the State Department – my first thought was: “She just didn’t discover that day the Saudis and the Qataris are supporting ISIS. When did she know that, when did she formulate this absolutely absurd policy?” RT:\\xa0Clearly she was formulating policy with her staff knowing that she was going to run for president. But she didn’t announce until a year later. What insight do these e-mails give us on what kind of president she would be and what kind of foreign policy she would advocate? JJ: One thing I noticed, by the way, she says “pressure the Saudis,” but she doesn’t say pressure to do exactly what? She doesn’t say in so many words: “Make them stop supporting ISIS,” and … she’s got a lot of money in the foundation from these people. So I think she will continue to trade carefully with governments we know are supporting terrorists. She would continue to have an unrealistic policy about where we want to go with this.

Where does that leave the US? Is it at a crossroads of making a decision? JJ: I think we [the US] are. The Obama administration I believe just simply wants to keep it simmering until Hillary – President Obama hopes – takes office. He wants Assad out for what reason? Because we said so. It really boils down to that. That was the position we took – this whole mythology of the Arab Spring; that this is all caused by the oppressive government. And it is not in the real world.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'Yume was given to the Russian president by the governor of Japan’s Akita prefecture as a three-month-old puppy four years ago, in a symbolic gesture of gratitude to Russia for its help following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. On Tuesday, Putin was scheduled to give an interview to Nippon TV and Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper ahead of a landmark visit to Japan, and the Kremlin said that the journalists requested to check up on how well the dog was doing in her new homeland. Putin obliged, and brought Yume to the pre-interview photo-call – but this is where things went rapidly off-script. As the presidential pool cameras clicked, the dog began barking loudly and inching towards the interviewers, who stood frozen with – somewhat mortified – smiles, as the scene threatened to turn into an international incident. Putin, who was holding the leash, remained unperturbed, before pulling out dog treats from the pocket of his business suit. This seemed to have the desired effect, with Yume eating out of Putin’s palm and rising on her hind legs, to the delight of the press pack. The dog was then led away so the interview could commence. “I was told that you wanted to see my dog, Yume. You can see that she is in great shape,” began Putin. Yomiuri Shimbun Managing Editor Takeshi Mizoguchi admitted that he was “surprised” and “scared” by the dog. “You were right to take caution, Yume is a no-nonsense dog. There are many people here, with camcorders running, lights shining, and cameras clicking. She is being a guard dog,” explained the Russian president. The dog was in a similarly uncooperative mood in 2014, when she was brought out to meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, during crucial trade talks in Sochi. Photos from the meeting show Putin petting the animal, while Abe keeps a respectful distance. The Russian leader admitted afterwards that Yume is prone to biting. Prior to the visit, Japan revealed that it wanted to gift a “bridegroom” to Yume, another pedigree Akita, but the Kremlin refused. Neither side gave an explanation for the reason. It is possible that the Kremlin was wary of adding another member of the famously independent-minded and protective breed to its kennels, or perhaps it wanted to avoid devaluing a diplomatic gesture. Vladimir Putin is a well-known dog lover, and has been given multiple pups as gifts since first becoming president in 2000, including his beloved Labrador Retriever Konni, who died in 2014. Konni was involved in the most high-profile dog-related diplomatic incident of recent years, when she was accused of intimidating Angela Merkel, who has a fear of dogs, during a meeting with Putin in 2007. Putin said he had no idea about the German chancellor’s canine phobia, and apologized. '],\n",

              "  '“One of the reasons why Russia opposed the deployment of the American ABM [anti-ballistic missile] system in Europe was the concern that this infrastructure may be quickly converted to deploy strike systems, in particular land-based cruise missiles. These concerns are being confirmed today,” Senator Viktor Ozerov, who chairs the upper house’s Defense and Security Committee, told\\xa0Ria Novosi. The Russian lawmaker was referring to interceptor missile launchers deployed in Poland and Romania, which Washington insists are needed to protect Europe from a rocket attack. The vertical-launch systems are the same used on American missile cruisers to fire Tomahawk missiles. The US and Russia are both banned from having or even developing ground-based missiles with the range similar to Tomahawks by the INF Treaty signed in the late 1980s. But naval missiles are not subject to the document. Moscow says that in the event of a crisis, the US may use the ABM sites to fire Tomahawks at Russian territory. “In response to that we will be forced to beef up our air and space defense system in that direction, deploy additional forces to defend our military facilities and command centers. This includes the deployment of S-400 and Iskander systems in Kaliningrad, and the formation of new units in the Western and Southern military districts. In addition to mechanized and tank components those divisions would have units dedicated to air and space defense,” Ozerov said. The S-400 is a long-range anti-missile system used to protect strategic sites like large cities or ICBM silos from airstrikes. The Iskander is a tactical missile system capable of firing either ballistic or cruise missiles, including those carrying nuclear warheads. The Iskander system’s range is enough to reach the controversial US ABM sites. Ozerov added that Russia is developing new surface-to-air and air-to-surface missiles capable of piercing American missile shields. “It’s a dual task of overcoming the air defense systems and defending ourselves from a potential strike,” he explained. US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the deployment of S-400 and Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad was unnecessary and “destabilizing” to European security.  \"Russia has made threats to move its Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad for the past decade in response to a variety of developments in Europe, none of which demand such a military response,\" Kirby was cited as saying by Reuters.  \"We call on Russia to refrain from words or deeds that are inconsistent with the goal of promoting security and stability,\" he added.

V883 Orionis is located around 1,350 light years away from Earth and is 30 percent bigger than the Sun. “The ALMA observations came as a surprise to us,” astronomer Lucas Cieza and lead author of the report said in a statement. “Our observations were designed to image disk fragmentation, which is one of the proposed mechanisms for the formation of giant planets. “We saw none of that, as the disk is probably too warm to fragment despite its very large mass.

              "  \"RT:\\xa0 So the Dutch lawmakers have raised a number of questions over the MH17 tragedy - do you think they're likely to get any answers though? Julian Bray: If everything was equal they obviously should get an answer. And this whole question of 'war zones' and 'safe-height zones' has to be looked at again, because it really is a commercial decision as to whether an aircraft will actually go into a conflict zone. You are taking civilians into conflict zones and really the operators have to look at it again, because at the end of the day, it is really up to the captain of the aircraft to decide whether he is going to fly on that particular schedule. RT:\\xa0 Ukraine did not notify the European Air Traffic Organization ‘EuroControl’ about the fact that its radars hadn't been working. Why has Ukraine not been brought to account? JB: Well, you would think so. As long as you notify something that is not working, then of course you get additional assistance from the air traffic controllers because they squawk out little numbers and the numbers can be picked up so you can actually track the aircraft. But the real problem is if you got warring factions on the ground, you really need to have some kind of communication system, even if it is just a cellphone. But it has to be something. So if the civil aircraft is going over a war zone it has to be safe. And lets face it, flying over a war zone can never be safe. RT:\\xa0Why do you think the US has not handed the key information it claims to have about the shooting down of the jet to the investigators? JB: You've got to remember this is military intelligence and I can quite see why the military will be rather loathed to hand it over. They would have to hand it over in such a way that none of their secrets - because by backtracking through the software, through the images - you can actually geo-position where all of their military satellites are at any given time. So there are 101 different reasons why they won't hand it over but they have actually opened the door, because they say they have irrefutable proof, now, if they have the proof then somehow they're going to have to release it. RT:\\xa0 So realistically are we in a situation where there could actually be several parties in this investigation who have for their own self interest to hold back the information that could help the investigation. JB: Well unfortunately that is the way of the world these days. And you are talking about conflict zones, so nothing is normal. But the point is you are actually taking holiday makers and long distance air travelers through these war zones. They are not part of the war and should never be targets in the first place. And so I think the airlines have to get together and consider whether they are going to absolutely bar going through conflict zones, which I'm afraid will put the price of air travel right up. And at the end of the day that is the real crack of the matter. Is it commercially viable?

              "  'news',\n",
              "  '“Each attack, each act of terrorism, is one too many. Islamist terrorism has arrived in Germany,” Horst Seehofer, the governor of the German state of Bavaria, told reporters on Tuesday. The official gave a joint news conference with Bavaria’s interior minister, Joachim Hermann, following a summit of the local government, where security issues dominated the agenda. Last week, the country’s southern regions, including Bavaria, were shaken by four assaults, three of which were perpetrated by migrants. Officials in Germany are investigating two of the incidents as potentially linked to or inspired by Islamist extremism. Earlier, following the violence, Bavaria’s justice minister, Winfried Bausback, had also claimed that Islamist terror has “arrived in Germany,” stressing that the country should “take that into account.” During Tuesday’s press conference, Seehofer said Germany is facing\\xa0“a new dimension of terror,”\\xa0while Bavaria’s interior minister announced that the state’s police ranks would be increased. Hermann also suggested that Germany’s army (Bundeswehr) could be used to aid police in dealing with major terror threats. The debate over whether to deploy the Bundeswehr domestically should not wait\\xa0“until the next attack happens,”\\xa0he stressed, as quoted by General-Anzeiger. Lawmakers in Berlin are also discussing the possibility of establishing\\xa0“troops of reservists”\\xa0to aid police during internal crisis situations, German media outlet Bild reported, citing its own sources. In July, Germany approved its new military roadmap, the White Paper, which allows for the use of the German army inside the country in cases of large-scale terror attacks. Officials in Germany are now also pushing for greater controls and screenings for asylum seekers. “We need to know who is in our country,” Seehofer said on Tuesday, insisting that the authorities should now consider various ways dealing with refugees that commit crimes. “You have to seriously consider how such people should be treated if they violate laws or pose a threat,” he told Suddeutsche Zeitung, adding that the country cannot retreat from terror out of a sense of “prudence.” Meanwhile, Bavaria’s interior minister went a step further, suggesting that refugees lacking ID’s must be “stopped at the border,” while migrants already in the country should be re-checked. “A deportation into a war zone should not be taboo as well,” Hermann said, referring to criminal refugees. Bavaria’s governor and interior minister are now waiting for the German government to take action, stating that the\\xa0“people’s concerns”\\xa0should be addressed. Germany’s federal minister of interior, Thomas de Maiziere, tried to calm emotions following the attacks, saying that refugees\\xa0“should not be put under general suspicion.” In reaction, German MP Armin Schuster said: “We need a deportation culture,” as quoted by Stuttgarter Zeitung. “Some people get a feeling they can do whatever they want,” he added, slamming Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door policy towards migrants. In the meantime, another MP and member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party (CDU), Volker Kauder, has also advocated for deportation processes to be sped up. “Criminals should be convicted faster and, where there is a legal possibility, deported,” he said, as quoted by Die Zeit. Regulating the migrant influx was flagged as a “major task” for Germany in the latest poll conducted by market research company GFK, in which 83% of respondents said they are “concerned” by the number of refugees in Germany – double the figure from last year’s report. German officials estimate that over a million migrants entered Germany in 2015, the majority of which came from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. '],\n",

As the struggle continues, some witnesses plead with the cops to stop using excessive force against the already subdued suspect. “Why are you hitting him?” “That don’t make no sense!” the onlookers are heard crying. “I am trying to help. If he stops fighting, I won’t hit him,” the cop’s civilian helper tells the onlookers. While those who have seen the video are accusing the police of resorting to violence without cause, the NYPD has dismissed those claims, insisting that the suspect had started the fight by punching one of the detectives in the nose. As the fighting proceeded, some of the witnesses say the police appeared to be on the losing side, and called 911. “These cops were taking a beating,” a witness cited by DNAinfo said.\\xa0 One of the officers, identified as Billy Acosta, was kicked and slammed in the face multiple times in the scuffle, leading to injuries resulting in “severe back and neck pain.” The other detective, Matthew Wright, also sustained injuries as Simmons allegedly forced him on his back, knocked his head on a countertop, and kicked him multiple times, including in the face. The detective even reportedly had to have plastic surgery on his nose and stiches on his head after the brawl and was out of service for a couple of months. Twenty-seven-year-old Simmons was reportedly wanted in connection with several burglaries and for breaking parole. In December of last year, he is believed to have broken into two households in the Bronx. At one home he allegedly stole “numerous amounts of sneakers, a PlayStation video game system and a set of car keys to a GMC Yukon,” and he reportedly\\xa0made away with stolen jewelry items and a phone charger at the other, according to police, as cited by the New York City Patch.

We did not assault him,” a NYPD police spokesman stated on Friday. A NYPD Citizen’s Complaint Review Board probe into the incident was dropped soon after being launched with no charges brought against the officers. After his arrest, the Bronx District Attorney’s Office brought nine counts against Simmons based on a criminal complaint by police. The charges include disorderly conduct, offering resistance to police, assault, and harassment.

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  'Lieutenant General Mark Carleton-Smith said Jabhat al-Nusra (Al-Nusra Front) is the strongest remaining Al-Qaeda franchise, identified by some analysts as a more serious long-term threat than Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), and potentially associated with an element of British foreign fighters in Syria. He was giving evidence to the Commons Defence Committee on its inquiry into UK military operations in Syria and Iraq. Carleton-Smith said the group is not currently being targeted in British airstrikes, but the UK is ready to act if a “direct and imminent” threat to national security emerges. He warned there is a “real danger” the group remains an “abscess in the system” and might “represent a Petri dish that becomes a threat to UK national security.” Carleton-Smith said the group, which first emerged in 2011, is a mix of fighters concentrating on the civil war in Syria and those with a wider agenda. “A significant proportion are Syrian-focused that provide a wider wrapping to those much more specifically AQ-aligned [Al-Qaeda-aligned] elements that might harbour the ambition to use Syria as a springboard for an international terrorist attack plan. “There is potentially an element of British foreign fighters associated with it.” Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there is “real momentum” behind the Iraqi offensive against IS. “Clearly progress has been made. There is a real sense of momentum now of the Iraqi and Kurdish forces advancing. That needs to be sustained,” he said. But committee head Julian Lewis questioned Fallon on the numbers of IS opposition fighters, with whom Britain is waging a military campaign in Syria, asking how many of the estimated 70,000 are “moderate” or “hardline” Islamists. “The question is whether they are moderate or Islamists. The prime minister himself admitted a significant number of the people he had been talking about are relatively hardline Islamists,” Lewis said. “We have had testimony from several witnesses who make it quite clear that the overwhelming majority of opposition forces, of opposition with people with guns, are Islamists.” Fallon responded by saying: “The test is of all these groups is are they prepared to live within a plural political settlement that can in the end be democratic and take Syria towards elections. “We can argue for a very long time about these precise definitions of what is a moderate Muslim, what is an Islamist, what is someone beyond the pale or whatever. “The political process that is now getting underway does enable us to start to ask these various groups to make their choice - whether they are prepared to work with us for a political settlement and to be part eventually of a democratic process.” Fallon also acknowledged that IS, which has already established a foothold in Libya, could seek to expand its operations internationally as it came under pressure in Syria and Iraq. “That is certainly possible that we see attacks increase elsewhere in proportion to the way that they are being diminished in their caliphate. We will have to continue to be extremely vigilant about that,” he said. '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'Politicians from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the party chaired by Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer, have warned the government of making too many concessions to Turkey in light of the recent agreement to settle the European refugee crisis. “The EU’s negotiating position has undoubtedly worsened over the past months because of the EU’s internal strife on the refugee crisis. The Turks were putting forward new demands and raised the price [of the deal] like at the bazaar,” the CSU’s secretary general, Andreas Scheuer, told Passauer Neue Presse newspaper on Wednesday. “CSU is against Turkey’s EU accession and against a full-scale visa-free regime for all Turks.”However, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told journalists on Wednesday the EU is not going to lower its demands for Turkey to be granted visa-free travel to Europe. \"We will now speed up the examination of whether the necessary requirements that Turkey must fulfill, the necessary criteria, are satisfied,\" he was quoted by Reuters as saying. \"We are ready, where appropriate, to accelerate this but there will not be any lowering of quality standards,\" he said. According to Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a visa-free regime between the EU and Turkey could be established by the end of June. French President Francois Hollande, however, said that “visa liberalization could take place in June if the criteria are respected, there are 72 [of them].” Chancellor Merkel welcomed the prospect of a visa-free regime, although she stressed that Ankara’s bid to join the EU “was not on the agenda.” The outcomes of the EU-Turkey summit were met with skepticism by some ministers in Merkel’s cabinet. “I envision the visa liberalization and accelerated talks on [Turkey’s] EU accession critically,” German Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt was quoted as saying by Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. Any visa-free regime, he said, has to come with clear rules, restrictions and controls. “Otherwise it will create a basis for a new illegal migration.” “Turkey plays ‘cat and mouse’ with us,” the vice-chairman of the CSU faction in the Bundestag, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said. Previously, the EU said it would offer Turkey €3 billion (US$3.3 billion) between now and 2018, in addition to the €3 billion it had already promised to implement the scheme last year. In return, under the deal, for every Syrian national readmitted by Turkey from Greek islands, another Syrian will be resettled from Turkey to the EU countries. The UN’s human rights body previously criticized the “quick fix” deal, saying it will expose migrants to huge risks as well as violate EU and international laws on the right to protection. Speaking at a UN briefing on Tuesday, Vincent Cochetel, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Europe Bureau Director, stressed that \"collective expulsion of foreigners is prohibited under the European Convention on Human Rights.” '],\n",

The diplomat was commenting on a proposal made by the Institute of National Remembrance – the state sponsored group founded for taking care of the archives and investigating “crimes against the Polish nation.” The institute’s president Lukasz Kaminski said in a recent press interview that he wanted to create a register of monuments installed in Poland in memory of Soviet soldiers who fought and died in this country during WWII. He proposed, however, to get rid of those not placed on actual burial sites. Kaminsky said in his view these monuments didn’t symbolize the liberation of the country from German troops, but the domination of the Communist system. He said his group would encourage local authorities to tear them down. He added that the initiative did not apply to monuments at the graves and cemeteries of Soviet soldiers, and that the Polish state would continue to take care of these sites.

Besides, such actions are a direct violation of Poland’s international obligations, fixed in the 1994 intergovernmental agreement and in the 1992 treaty between our states,” he said.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"The US president has had a few notable things to say about Russia in recent years. For instance, how it’s a “regional power [that] doesn’t make anything” with its “economy in tatters” which is “isolated.” He also believed for a long time that it had no immigrants – despite being the second most popular migration destination\\xa0in the world. \\xa0 This week, Obama has suddenly changed his stance. And Russia has been upgraded, in his estimation, from a puny Danny De Vito to a towering Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\xa0 He told reporters in Washington how “we think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours.”\\xa0 Now, while his new stance is a bit more accurate, not to mention sure to go down well in Moscow, it also confirms how all over the shop Obama is when it comes to understanding Russia.\\xa0 Especially if you consider what he said next. Obama criticized Donald Trump for flattery toward a Kremlin supremo, which Obama said was “unprecedented” in US politics. Completely forgetting the time when a gravely ill Franklin D. Roosevelt travelled to Tehran to meet Josef Stalin, who refused to venture to Cairo. His successor, Harry Truman, later agreed to visit Yalta for the post-World War II peace conference because the Soviet leader didn’t fancy flying. Obama also failed to remember Bill Clinton comparing Boris Yeltsin to Abraham Lincoln, back in the nineties. The high praise\\xa0was for suppressing the Chechen rebellion. This later became a bad thing when Putin inherited Yeltsin’s conflict and implemented much the same policies, just more successfully. Because in American eyes, Putin is bad, whereas Yeltsin could do little wrong. Of course, Russians – who were directly affected by both leaders’ choices – tend to take a completely opposite view of the two presidents’ record in office.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Obama (falsely) appoints Putin as KGB chief in frantic attack on Trump Anyway, back to Obama’s direct comments on Russia’s status. His “regional power” assertion always seemed ludicrous in light of his own engagement with it. After all, if Russia were truly restricted to its own hinterland, why negotiate together on Syria? Not to mention Iran, where the Moscow-aided atomic deal is widely considered the current administration’s finest foreign policy achievement. Plus, how comical anyway was referring to owner of the planet’s pre-eminent nuclear arsenal as a local actor? Then there’s the idea of Russia not making anything. Where does Obama think they got all those weapons we see on display in Syria? Or did the President ever manage to explain how American astronauts get to the International Space Station these days? Because even schoolchildren know that they hitch a ride on Russia’s Soyuz craft.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Neither Clinton nor Trump likely Putin preferences for White House Perhaps Obama thought the Russians were buying this equipment, but that wouldn’t tally with the notion of how the economy is “in tatters.” Which was nonsense anyway, because according to IMF estimates for 2016, Russia boasts the sixth-biggest economy in the world, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Now, it’s true to say nominal dollar GDP has taken a big hit since the 2014 currency crisis, but Moscow isn’t paying out on wages, pensions and most general budget expenditure in greenbacks, it’s doing so in\\xa0rubles.\\xa0It’s also worth comparing the Russian economy ($3.7 trillion) to other UN Security Council permanent members such as France ($2.7 trillion) and Britain ($2.8 trillion).\\xa0 Let’s not forget the “isolation” argument either. A cursory glance at Putin’s website shows\\xa0how in the past eight days he has had private and personal meetings with the following: South Africa’s Jacob Zuma, China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Brazil’s Michel Temer, Armenia’s Serzh Sargsyan, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. He’s also conducted phone calls with Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Francois Hollande and the new United Nations’ Secretary General Antonio Guterres. This is not the diary of the leader of an “isolated” country, is it? So, Obama has changed tack. And that’s fair enough. Russia is now “large and important,” albeit “aggressive.” Naturally, the US itself is never threatening or combative and its bombs are made of candy.\\xa0 READ MORE:\\xa0Putin: White House uses Russia scaremongering to manipulate Americans Let’s be clear, Obama’s overall interaction with Russia has been disastrous. He never understood the country, nor apparently wanted to get a proper grasp on it. To compound matters, the US president also chose badly when it came to advisors on the subject. Hiring the likes of Michael McFaul – whose brief tenure as ambassador to Moscow was catastrophic, hanging out with fringe opposition activists upon arrival being about the silliest move possible – and allowing Victoria (“F**k the EU”) Nuland to be retained as the State Department’s point person in Russia’s neighborhood.\\xa0 In 2012, Obama was unwittingly recorded telling former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that\\xa0he would be more “flexible” on Russia upon his re-election for a second term. As Obama’s presidency enters its lame duck last months, there’s still a brief window to salvage something from Washington-Moscow relations.\\xa0 If Obama fails to grasp this chance, he'll leave his successor civil wars in Ukraine and Syria to manage and a dysfunctional rapport with the Kremlin to transform. Tuesday’s comments suggest reality has finally dawned on him. Is it too late?

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The Kübler-Ross model of trauma describes the emotional pathway for any European with an interest in protecting the continent his forebears created from the perfidy of national leaders whose actions will breed him and his children out of existence. First there was denial: surely Angela Merkel couldn’t be so stupid as to sink the European ship? Next came anger as news of the\\xa0organized attacks by so-called asylum-seekers on European white women seeped through the checkpoints\\xa0embedded in the mainstream media machine. Then came the stage known as bargaining as people thought they would settle for some\\xa0restrictions on numbers so long as the tidal wave was stopped. And now we are at enforced acceptance: the tidal wave will not stop – so get used to it – with Jeremy Corbyn, for example,\\xa0calling for the UK to take similar numbers as Germany. If you feel like you didn’t vote for any of this, that’s because you didn’t. Your opinion isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. It’s people like\\xa0George Soros who are making these decisions. Your job is to shut up, pay taxes, and learn to\\xa0get on board with this new round of social engineering and ethnic cleansing. But now that it is obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that – hand-wringing apart – the fix is in, it is interesting to observe how career politicians are talking now that the dust is settling on the new reality. Because talk is all that they will do. We are at the tipping point. And once we get over that, the ship is going down, make no mistake. The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, for example, has managed – albeit belatedly – to get an intellectual handle on what’s going on: the refugee crisis is\\xa0destabilizing Europe. Now, he does not mean what you and I mean by Europe: our countries, nations, languages and histories. He’s a\\xa0Bilderberger so he has at least a mid-level understanding of the actual plan and doesn’t care about any of the things the people who vote for him care about. He means the Union of European Soviet Socialist Republics; the Brussels oligarchy in other words. The Guardian writes: ‘He said a message to refugees that said “Come, you will be welcome” provoked major shifts in population.’ His grasp of the obvious now it is too late to do anything about it is impressive. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Europe was close to breaking point: “We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks.” But, he went on: “No one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive.” Geert Wilders is described by the liberal press as a\\xa0‘far-right’ Dutch politician. This means he has stayed roughly where our grandparents were while everyone else was processed by Cultural Marxism. Wilders has called for the invading, marauding males to be locked up in asylum centers and for the safety of Dutch women and girls to be put first. What a novel idea. This isn’t ‘far-right’. It is just right. But, we already know, it will never happen. RT\\xa0interviewed Hansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party. Mueller said: ‘Germany now is somewhere at the edge of anarchy and sliding towards civil war, or to become a \"banana republic without any government.\" He went on: ‘Bavaria is the first region because we are affected the most – we are living on the border to Austria where the influx of refugees stems from. But the second regions of Germany where this happens are Saxony and Thuringia. First of all, they have also borders to the Czech Republic, that’s the first reason. And the second reason is that in former Eastern Germany people are still aware of what it is living in a dictatorship. They are feeling quite well that our so-called democracy is sliding more and more towards a totalitarian state.’’ Interesting and objectively correct words. But then Mueller does not hold any real power. Donald Tusk, on the other hand – as chief apparatchik in the European Soviet machine – does have power. He now\\xa0warns that we have only two months to get things under control. This means, of course, when after two months the invasion is only worse, we will be expected to accept the situation as fait accompli. Tusk also has a holy reverence for the nonsense known as the Schengen Agreement and warned that if Europe fails to make the strategy work “we will face grave consequences such as the collapse of Schengen,” the 26-nation passport-free travel zone. How complicated is it? There is nothing holy about the Schengen Agreement – the UK is not party to it, for example. But European leaders talk about it as though it were\\xa0somehow problematic to revoke it. It’s not. The Schengen is an idea. The invasion of Europe and the destruction of the ancient cultures within it, however, is very real. If these were not ‘refugees’ but infantrymen (even ones without guns) arriving from – let’s say – North Korea, this problem would not have got to first base. This is an invasion. But because it is dressed up in the garb Europeans fall for every time – the language of compassion – we are now in a state where European women\\xa0cannot walk unmolested in their own streets or\\xa0use public pools without being subjected to degradation. Given the political will, this problem can be fixed in a five-minute conversation. It’s a group Skype call at best. The fact that this doesn’t happen belies the reality: the fix is in, and politicians like Valls and apparatchiks like Tusk are trying to distance themselves from the inevitable fallout. This is why they are saying things they think people will want to hear: not because they are going to step up and do what is necessary, but because they don’t want the coming chaos attached to their names. The solution is obvious: stop ‘saving’ all the ships arriving in Europe; put officers with real powers on borders, and have anyone without a passport or other valid ID immediately ejected from the EU space. And border guards both at the peripheries of individual countries and the EU itself should be told in clear and uncertain terms what their job is: to protect what’s behind them from what’s in front of them. If EU border guards’ pay was inversely indexed to the number of persons shown to have entered the EU illegally – and if internal police had equivalent motivations – this problem would be solved in a month. If there is a genuine case for asylum – based on the existing legal framework – the place for that discussion is on the border of the EU, not within it. Germany has followed Switzerland in\\xa0confiscating the assets of ‘refugees’ over a certain value – shown to be\\xa0four-figure sums on average. This will do nothing other than ensure that the next wave comes with nothing, or has it sent over in parcels later. The real causes for invasion lie with neo-colonialism and the banking cartel which drives it – ‘philanthropists’ such as Soros – and NATO’s genocide against Libya and the murder of Gaddafi – who was holding back the population floodgates for us. NATO has no compunction about killing people in very large numbers when it suits the bankers’ agenda. The fact that Europe’s military is pussy-footing around now that we actually need soldiers to do their only legitimate job – defend our borders – suddenly everyone is Albert Schweitzer. The case is so plain, even 16 year-old German girls with no previous interest in ‘politics’ are getting it. Anyone who suggests taking effective action is labelled ‘far-right’ by the liberal media which panders to those whose intellects are bypassed by means of emotional trigger-words such as ‘compassion’. But the motif of the ship is a fair one. When a ship goes down there are never enough lifeboats. Sailors are trained to beat off with violence those still in the sea once the lifeboat is full. If they do not – everyone dies. This is real compassion. If there is a silver lining in this tale of corruption and perfidy it is this: the liberal’s catch-all justification for his crimes against his own people – that of pleading ‘compassion’ – is no longer beyond criticism. People have had enough. Wanting your family and your culture to survive does not make you evil. This is not a game; it is deadly serious. And if the helm cannot be wrest from those bent on taking the ship down, it’s time for those with the wit and the means to make a quiet move for the exits. @SamGerrans The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

              "  \"Hillary Clinton has made history in becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. But Bernie Sanders vows to fight on for what he calls “an American Revolution.” What do his words “fight on” mean exactly, and what's next for his campaign and his supporters? We will find out with Cenk Uygur, host of the online news and commentary show The Young Turks, founder and CEO of the TYT network, and vocal Bernie Sanders supporter and defender. Larry King: You have to be brought down by the size of the California defeat…Where are you now? Cenk Uygur: First of all, Hillary Clinton was likely to win the pledge delegates comfortably even if Bernie Sanders had won California. So, it's not like we didn't know going into the night that it wasn't going to be a great night no matter what. I am surprised at the size of the California win for Hillary Clinton. I don't know how much it had to do with the Associated Press and the rest of the press saying: “Don't show up to vote. This race is already over.” LK: Well, they didn't say “don't show up.” CU: I mean, by declaring “the race over” that is in effect what you're saying. In fact, they had record registration, more people signing up to vote, but then it was actually 28 percent lower turnout than in 2008. That's because every press outlet said: “This race is already over.” You know, that if the press declares the race over, then less people are going to show up to vote. LK: But Bernie [Sanders] said on Tuesday: “The struggle continues. We're going to fight hard to win the primary in Washington, D.C. We take our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia… “What is taking the fight mean? \\xa0 CU: I'll give you my interpretation, because I don't speak for Bernie Sanders. She has won a lot more pledged delegates. If all things being equal, she's got more super delegates, more pledged delegates; the race is over, she's won. Right? Now, there is one wild card because things are not normal. She is under federal investigation and so there might be an indictment. I have no idea what the chances of that indictment are. People think: “By bringing it up, you're rooting for it.” No, the FBI isn't listening to the Young Turks and thinking: “I wonder if we should act based on what they say.” I'm just telling you that there's some chance that that happens. And if it does, well then that would be a giant wild card. Because the very last election is a super delegate election; they have not voted yet, they vote on July 25. If there's an indictment between here and there, then they would get to say: “Okay, of course.” LK: Why doesn't Bernie, at least, if that happens…Why doesn't he make peace now? Bring the party together because the last thing he wants is a Trump presidency. CU: That's certainly true and we don't know what he means by carrying on the campaign. My suggestion was to suspend the campaign with reserving the right to re-enter if there's an indictment. It's ironic that he doesn't like talking about the indictment; he thinks that's too much of an attack against Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, the most important part of this, and to the point of your first question, it means we are going to fight for progressive ideas no matter what. Whether we win the delegate count, whether we win the primary or not, whether we win the election or not…No matter what happens, this political revolution continues.

              "  ' An idea to get rid of foreign software from computers used by Russian authorities was backed by President Vladimir Putin due to his security concerns after the relationship between Moscow and the West deteriorated over Ukrainian crisis.

              "  \"One week ago, on February 10, units from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance captured Menagh airbase and several surrounding villages in northwest Syria from Al-Qaeda franchise Jabhat Al-Nusra and their allies Ahrar Al Sham, who had held it since August 2013. One might think the liberation of such a significant asset would be a cause for celebration amongst the NATO powers who are, after all, supposedly facing an existential threat from Al-Qaeda and its various offshoots. But apparently not. By the weekend, NATO member Turkey was shelling the base and its surrounding regions, with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu vowing to render it “unusable” unless the SDF withdraw – that is to say, hand it back to Al-Qaeda. Their bombardment has continued ever since, hitting Syrian government forces in the town of Deir Jamal, as well as the SDF. Davutoglu promised “the harshest reaction” if the SDF were to take the town of Azaz – currently controlled by, you guessed it,\\xa0Ahrar al Sham and Al-Qaeda – towards which they were rapidly advancing. “We will not allow Azaz to fall,” he said, ‘fall’ here being a euphemism for liberation from the Wahhabi death squads. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have been regularly briefing the media about their desire to send their armies into Syria, to establish a ‘safe zone’ on the Turkish-Syrian border aimed at keeping open the supply lines to rebel-controlled territories such as Aleppo (dominated, according to the Institute for the Study of War, by Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Ahrar Al Sham). Turkish military sources have subsequently announced that Saudi jets are to be deployed at the Incirlik airbase in Turkey within the coming weeks. For some commentators, all of this demonstrates that Turkey has somehow gone ‘rogue’, putting it at odds with the US and straining the sinews of its alliance. Turkey is facilitating militant jihadis, it is argued, whilst the US is trying to fight them; and it is attacking the SDF, who the US is supporting. The SDF is, after all, an official ally of the US, who has been advancing thanks in part to US air support – yet is viewed by Turkey as a terrorist group due to the presence in their ranks of the Kurdish YPG, who have fraternal relations with the PKK, with whom the Turkish state has been at war for decades. For the Guardian, “the Turkish strikes…triggered alarm in Washington”, whilst a Reuters headline\\xa0suggested that the “Kurdish advance in Syria divides US and Turkey”. “Following Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's remarks calling on the US to choose between its ally Turkey and “the terrorists in Kobani,”\\xa0wrote the Turkish newspaper Sunday’s Zaman “Ankara is now not on good terms with the US”. The reality, however, is that Turkey appears to have had US approval every step of the way. Take, for example, the official US reaction to the Turkish shelling. Statements by State Department spokesman John Kirby have generally been depicted as ‘admonishing’ Turkey for its actions. In fact, he called for “de-escalating tensions on all sides,” adding that “we have urged Syrian Kurdish and other forces affiliated with the YPG not to take advantage of a confused situation by seizing new territory.” In other words, he has repeated Turkey’s demands that northwest Syria be left under Al-Qaeda control. This hardly qualifies as a major dressing down. Also hugely important to note is that right between the seizure of Menagh on Wednesday and the beginning of Turkish shelling on Saturday, NATO had 2 important meetings: one formal, one informal. On Thursday, buried deep in an announcement about NATO operations in the Aegean Sea, Secretary\\xa0General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned that NATO had also agreed “to intensify intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance at the Turkish-Syrian border.” That was the formal meeting. Later that day – that is just one day before the International Syria Support Group announced plans for a “cessation of hostilities” - the defense secretaries of the US, the UK, Turkey and the Gulf states met at NATO HQ to discuss the possibility of inserting ground troops into Syria and establishing a “no-fly zone” on the Syrian-Turkish border. Talking in advance of this meeting, US Defense Secretary\\xa0Ash Carter appeared to relish such action, welcoming the prospect of “strong contributions” from the Gulf States, which he said would be a “good thing”. “There are lots of different ways that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain can contribute,” he noted, “one of them is on the ground – and we’ll definitely be discussing that – but there are lots of other ways as well.” Two days later, Turkey began shelling Syria. Ostensibly, these were meetings of the ‘anti-ISIS’ coalition. But, as the Guardian innocently noted, “Given that the US and its allies have been in action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since September 2014, it is remarkable that the meeting on Thursday afternoon is the first to be held by the defense ministers from the anti-ISIS coalition.” What has really prompted their sense of urgency has nothing to do with the ‘phony‘ war against ISIS, and everything to do with the growing military success of the Syrian government. Rhetorical nonsense about the need to ‘combat ISIS’ notwithstanding, it is clear that Turkey and the West remain very much on the same page over Syria. There is indeed a red line for both, and that red line is the prospect of a Syrian government victory – which, following Russia’s decisive intervention now seems like a very real possibility. The major rebel supply line to Aleppo was cut off on February 3, meaning that both the recapture of Aleppo and the sealing of the Turkish-Syrian border now lie visibly within the government’s grasp. As Reuters has correctly noted, “That would amount to its most decisive victory of the war so far, and probably put an end to rebel hopes of removing Assad by force, their goal throughout years of fighting that has driven 11 million people from their homes.” Such an outcome would have monumental consequences for the entire globe. It would mark the first decisive defeat for a Western-sponsored regime change operation since the end of the Cold War, perhaps since Vietnam. It would demonstrate that the new ‘4+1’ alliance (of Iran, Iraq, Russia, Syria and Hezbollah) are able to inflict defeat on Western-backed forces, rendering US sponsorship and protection all but worthless. It would provide states over the world with the military rationale (the economic rationale is already obvious) for aligning themselves with the BRICS rather than the US. And it would make sectarian death squads throughout the region, for long the ‘cheap power’ arm of US and British foreign policy, wary of ever again relying on Western backing. In short, it would mark an unprecedented and irreversible shift in power from West to East. There is no way that the Western powers are going to allow this to happen lying down. And plans are rapidly being drawn up to avoid this. The aim is to ensure the Syrian-Turkish border stays open, to guarantee that the rebels supply lines are not jeopardized; this is the only way to avoid defeat in, not only, Aleppo, but in Syria as a whole. How to do this? First, Turkey is filling the Syrian side of its border crossing with refugees to act as human shields. Last week, for the first time, President Erdogan closed the border to fleeing refugees, instead setting up camps inside Syria. These will provide the ‘collateral damage’ necessary to paint any Syrian government-Kurdish – Russian moves to take the territory and seal the border as a massacre and humanitarian emergency. Erdogan’s comments last week that the United Nations needed to step in to prevent “ethnic cleansing” are clearly part of the ideological groundwork to prepare for a ‘humanitarian intervention’ which, in reality, will serve to create a NATO-backed, Turkish and Saudi-enforced, occupation zone in northwest Syria designed to keep the border open, keep the death squads supplied with weapons and fighters, and, in short, keep the war going. Far from angering Washington, Turkey’s actions put it right at the vanguard of US strategic designs. Make no mistake; the US is preparing to fight Russia – right down to the last Turk.

Once he was elected, Barajas only grew more suspicious about corruption in the city’s government. \"I knew some things were not being correctly taken care of,” he said. Mayor Ricardo Lopez took $6,000 from Nguyen to buy a car and told city employees to \"make it easy” while inspecting Nguyen’s property, the federal indictment alleges. In return, he allegedly waived some taxes for Nguyen and redoubled his efforts to made extra effort to shut down other operators of “8-liner” gaming rooms, which flourish throughout southern Texas despite their illegal status. The indictment also says that Lopez and the other officials — Mayor Pro Tempore Rogelio Mata, councilman Roel Mata and former councilman Gilbert Urrabazo — voted to extend city manager and city attorney William Jonas’s $216,000-a-year contract in exchange for his managing of their bribery schemes.

It was not immediately clear whether the notice published in the French Official Journal was mandatory or advisory. The French guidelines state that in accordance with Commission rules adopted in November 2015, importers must mark the precise place from which the goods originate and not mark them as products of Israel. Regulations apply to products that originate in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which are considered occupied territories under international law. French authorities said that clearly marking the packaging is necessary to not mislead consumers. Goods originating from Palestinian territories must be marked for instance as originating from “the West Bank”, and then, in parenthesis, the package must also be labeled that it comes from “an Israeli settlement.” When in November 2015 European Commission guidelines were adopted, Brussels stated that enforcing the regulations is the responsibility of the authorities within each of the 28 EU countries. A year later France decided to implement the new rules, unleashing condemnation from Israel, which considers the move a “boycott” of Israeli products. It calls the new regulations as embodying “double standards.” “It is a puzzling and disturbing fact that France chooses to implement a double standard when it comes to Israel while ignoring the 200 territorial conflicts which are taking place today across the world, including those taking place right on their doorstep,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We regret that France, of all countries, in which a law exists against boycotts, is taking steps which can be interpreted as a nod of support to radical elements and the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] BDS movement against Israel,” the statement added.

RT: The US dismissed the upcoming parliamentary elections in Syria. Why is it denying legitimacy to a democratic vote? Jim Jatras: Because the American government has already decided that Bashar Assad is not a legitimate head of a government, this is not a legitimate government, it has to be overthrown. And anything they do will simply be condemned out of hand by the US government whether there is any basis for it or not. This is despite the fact that in 2014 Syria carried out a presidential election, Syrians all over the world voted in it and we saw people abroad in places like Lebanon, Jordan actively and enthusiastically participating in these elections. There is no reason to think that a very substantial part of the Syrian population, I would say a majority, supports this government and supports these elections. \\xa0 RT: But is there much point in holding a general election now while the talks in Geneva are still ongoing? JJ: Everybody says - and this includes the US and its allies: We want to see a democratic evolution in Syria. We want to see democracy in Syria. I don’t think our Saudi friends, of course, want to have much of a democracy in Syria; they don’t have one in Saudi Arabia. But that is the position of the American government. We should be welcoming any kind of election and progress towards democracy in the areas where that is possible under these conflict circumstances. So, it makes no sense to me that the American government is condemning this vote. RT: Do you think the US stance on the election would be the same if the country in question was Iraq? JJ: No, of course not. And this is where some of the real hypocrisy comes in that if it is a government we support, then we will give a blessing to the election whether it was a valid election or not. If it is a government we are opposed to no matter what they do we will condemn it. This is simply another example where the identity in your relationship with US policy and whether the government is controlled by people in Washington is the determination of whether the elections are legitimate. Not whether they actually reflect the will of the people of that country. RT: Do you think a fair and inclusive election is possible while ceasefire violations continue? JJ: Nobody expects a perfect election in Syria under the circumstances. Is it fair within the limitations that a conflict imposes on a country? I would say that it is although again not perfect.

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  'Researchers made the breakthrough at the MoD’s military science park at Britain’s Porton Down laboratory. Neil Stansfield, from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is responsible for the research, told the Telegraph on Wednesday that the scanner freezes atoms with lasers and then gauges how they are affected by the gravitational pull of objects close to them. This can apparently help create a 3D map of an area. Stansfield told the newspaper the scanners could have a number of advantages. “Seeing underground is an obvious one. From a national security perspective, the potential is obvious if you can see caves and tunnels,” he said. It’s also claimed that the device is impossible to jam or confuse because it does not “send out waves” of any kind. “We are detecting the gravitational influence on an object. There’s nothing that we are sending out that can be interfered with,” Stansfield said. Non-military uses could include helping road workers find buried pipes. Stansfield told the Telegraph that the technology, while not ready for use currently, would be fully functional sooner than people think.\\xa0 “I think until about five years ago, this was seen as laboratory stuff and it will be 20 or 30 years before we can harness this,” he said. It has also been argued that gravity technology could come to replace global positioning systems (GPS), which are vulnerable to electronic attacks like jamming. Gravity navigation, known as quantum sensing, remains an experimental field, according to experts. However, a recent DSTL paper\\xa0says that the technology has “the potential to enhance existing, or enable new defense capabilities including positioning, navigation, communications, control and sensing.” The claim that gravity scanners are immune to jamming comes at a time when a covert technology debate is underway. As recently as Tuesday it was reported that UK infantry soldiers had field-tested a new stealth material at Fort Benning, Georgia, home of the US military’s experimental warfare facility. The material, called Vatec, would be used in camouflage clothing and to help build hides for teams of snipers. However, William Boothby, a former air force officer and lawyer, argued in a study published in the journal Weapons and the Law of Armed Conflict in March that the new systems may breach the laws of war. “A combatant whose weapon is rendered invisible by its coating is arguably not complying with the minimal requirements [of carrying a weapon openly],” Boothby claims. Such a move could leave the disguised combatant liable to what is termed a Prohibition of Perfidy under Article 37 of the Geneva Convention. It relates to a form of deception whereby one actor promises to act in good faith with the clear intention of scrapping that promise once its enemy is exposed. '],\n",

Chris Hedges, the host of ‘On Contact’ show on RT discussed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement with Israeli human rights activist Miko Peled. RT:\\xa0The Boycott, Divestment and Sanction Movement was established in 2005. Perhaps, it has potential to be the most effective movement. Could you explain what it is, how it started and its spread, especially now, in Europe and in the United States? Miko Peled: We need to start with the premise that not everybody accepts, which is that the Palestinians have a right to resist. The issue of resistance is somehow always left out of the conversation. Under international law they do have a right. But somehow when we talk about Palestinians, I think the word resistance gives some kind of legitimacy to their struggle. And therefore it is never part of the conversation: they can be victims, they can be terrorists. But that’s kind of it. I think what BDS has done among many things - is to have brought the issue of resistance to the forefront because it is very legitimate, it reminds us of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Could you layout what does Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions mean? MP: The call Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, to begin with, came out, which I think is an important point, from Palestinian civil society. Perhaps, the largest coalition of individuals and organizations from within Palestine came out with a call…for the world to support Palestine through imposing boycotts, divesting from and imposing sanctions on the State of Israel, against using the South African model. I think it captured people's imagination; it reminded people of this struggle against apartheid in South Africa. It is very dedicated and it's kind of the latest attempt of the Palestinian resistance. But it has a legitimacy that I think previous examples of the resistance didn't have. And I think, which is why it's being so successful and why it's being able to maintain itself. RT:\\xa0It has been quite successful in institutions such as the Presbyterian Church that I come out of, that supported it, very effective in Europe. Talk a little bit about what it has achieved. MP: Several things. The nice thing about their campaigns - they're very focused. They have been able to work on particular companies, for example, Veolia, which created the Light Rail in Jerusalem. [East Jerusalem is the Palestinian section of Jerusalem, which is being rapidly rebuilt. –Chris Hedges] The attempt has been right away as soon as East Jerusalem was taken in 1967, to expand Jewish West Jerusalem into it and eliminate any kind of Palestinian existence within it. And they’ve been very successful. This Light Rail was one of those examples. It was a very successful campaign\\xa0in working with Veolia and pressuring them to stop working with Israel. They work with other companies, there's the examples of Caterpillar and another work, there's a campaign on HP…and the idea is that companies that either work directly with Israel or have some more profit from the occupation or support the military occupation of Palestine need to be influenced in order just to stop working with Israel... I think it's important to also make a point that if we take a look at the United Nations definition of genocide and if we take a look at Israeli policies over the last 70 years in Palestine, the similarities are striking. It is almost point for point. We're talking about how and why this is happening, why there is a call to boycott Israel and why the BDS movement is making so much sense because something has to be done on a worldwide scale. It is not something that you can put a little bomb here or there. It is not that kind of thing. It requires a much more comprehensive, a well-planned, well-thought-out campaign and that's what BDS is. The campaign has to fit the crime and of course the crime of genocide and the crimes of Israel against the Palestinians are so severe that it requires a serious campaign to bring this reality that exists there to an end and allow people to start something new and replace it with something better.

Over 3,000 migrants who arrived under false identities have been sent back, border officials reported. Slovenia will also have to take a similar decision or cope with the rejected migrants, a Slovenian Interior Ministry official said. Austria has been engaged in trilateral talks with Germany and Slovenia aimed at finding new ways to manage the refugee and migrant influx.

The whole process was started by Germany, which since the beginning of January has been turning away hundreds of migrants with fake IDs heading to Sweden or Denmark.

By adding “mRNA that codes for red fluorescent protein” to a retrovirus and inserting it into cells, the translation could be seen. For the second challenge, Dr. Wu used a recently published technique to encode single-chain antibodies fused to green fluorescent protein to bind to a newly formed protein, “making the protein visible.” Visualizing the birth of proteins 🔬 https://t.co/WsXx5zKTlf Dr. Singer explained, “We know from genome-wide studies that translation controls protein abundance in cells – crucially important to every single function that cells carry out. Using this technology, we can finally learn how translation is regulated and gain major insights into diseases that occur when translation is faulty.” 'Compact & durable’: Scientists encode, retrieve 10,000 gigabytes stored on DNA moleculeshttps://t.co/SDOUu4pux0pic.twitter.com/GdfskSipLh The scientists observed the translation of single messenger RNA molecules in two types of cells: human cancer cells and mouse neurons. Then they made a surprising discovery. When they looked at the translation in mouse neurons, they noticed “mRNA translation into protein was found to occur in ‘bursts’ – a phenomenon never before possible to observe,” according to the Einstein statement. “Bursts of translation activity may be the best way for neurons to control the amount and location of protein production – and neurological disease may result from neurons’ inability to control that bursting,”\\xa0said Dr. Singer. “So our findings may have implications for intellectual disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome, which seem to involve too much protein production, and possibly for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s in which clumps of beta-amyloid protein may block neuron-to-neuron signaling at synapses.” 1000+ yr shelf life: Microsoft buys into synthetic DNA for data storagehttps://t.co/xFzWUzSRWkpic.twitter.com/TM1QDB2E7d When researchers looked at mRNA translation in cancer cells, they noticed that they “displayed a striking inability to regulate the translation of mRNA… instead it was [a] continuous process in these cells.” “Since proteins play crucial roles in controlling division, the uncontrolled translation of certain proteins may lead to certain types of cancer,” stated Einstein College. “With our technology, researchers can now study disease-causing protein aberrations at a very basic level that was never possible before,” said Dr. Singer. The paper entitled “Translation dynamics of single mRNAs in live cells and neurons,” was published in Science on Friday. \"],\n",

              "  'The US fast food chain told AFP it was claiming some €17.8 million ($19.65 million) in damages, saying the suit was being filed with the administrative court which arbitrates in governance disputes in Italy. The Piazza del Duomo, located in the heart of Florence’s historic city center, is a gem of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. Its buildings include the domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower, the Opera del Duomo Museum, and the St. John Baptistery. Florence\\'s mayor, Dario Nardella, rejected McDonald\\'s application in June, saying \"McDonald\\'s has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.\" \"We don\\'t have any prejudice [against McDonald\\'s],\" Nardella said, noting that the company had opened restaurants \"in other parts of town.\" A Facebook campaign launched to oppose the opening of a McDonald’s restaurant on the historic plaza received more than 17,000 likes. “There is no need for a McDonald’s in such a beautiful place. Italian street food is so good and so diverse. The customers and tourists have their own part to play in that story. If I go to Italy, I want to eat Italian food. There are McDonald’s enough on this planet,” one user wrote. “McDonald’s has ten million other places where they can sell what they call ‘food’ (I don\\'t think it is). But there is only one Piazza Duomo, and it should keep its cultural integrity. This is not a matter of competition for the cheapest food!” another person added. To make their point, FB users shared an edited photo of Michelangelo’s David, depicting the statue as obese, highlighting the argument that the restaurant would not only threaten the city\\'s cultural heritage, but endanger people’s health too. Last month plans to open a McDonald’s on a piazza next to Saint Peter’s Square in Rome had angered cardinals who live above the proposed site,\\xa0La Republicca reported, noting that if permission were granted, it could bring in €30,000 ($33,000) a month to the Vatican\\'s wallet. “It’s a questionable, aberrant choice, to say the least,” Cardinal Elio Sgreccia told the Italian daily, adding that the proposal to open a fast food branch near the historic square in Rome is “by no means respectful of the architectural traditions of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peter’s, [and is] visited every day by thousands of pilgrims and tourists.” '],\n",

              "  'business',\n",
              "  'Among the non-OPEC participants at the meeting were 12 oil exporting countries – Azerbaijan, Oman, Mexico, Sudan, South Sudan, Bahrain, Malaysia, Equatorial Guinea, Bolivia, Kazakhstan and Russia. The 558,000 b/d figure was voiced by Qatar\\'s energy minister\\xa0at a press conference following the six hour long talks. OPEC members also confirmed their commitment to the plan to reduce the oil supply by 1.2 million b/d. This, together with the commitments made by non-OPEC states, would lead to the total reduction of oil production by about 1.7-1.8 million b/d, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at the press conference. Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Falih told the press conference that 2017 would be a “good year” for the global oil market. The parties to the negotiations also agreed to form a special group to monitor the observance of the agreement both by the OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The group would consist of three OPEC members and two non-OPEC countries, Novak said. \"This agreement cements and prepares us for long-term cooperation,\" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters after the meeting, calling the deal \"historic\". \"Today\\'s deal will speed up the oil market stabilisation, reduce volatility, attract new investments,\" Novak said. The deal became the first such agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries since 2001. In April, OPEC and Russia tried to reach a deal on oil production which was cut during negotiations in Doha, but failed to come to an agreement, as Saudi Arabia sunk the deal at the last moment. OPEC made a decision to cut its own output on November 30. Following the decision, Saudi Arabia informed its customers in Europe and North America that it would cut its oil supply in January. According to PIRA Energy Group chairman Gary Ross, buyers of Saudi oil were informed that Riyadh wants to cut its production by 486,000 b/d to just over 10 million. UAE then followed suit and also announced that it would take similar action. While some non-OPEC countries are also expected to cut their oil production in January, others have said they might wait until October. OPEC’s November decision put an end to the ’pump-at-will’ policy the group has conducted since 2014, which sent oil prices down from $100 a barrel to less than $50 a barrel. Now, both OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters are trying to push prices up. The market reacted to the November move with rising oil prices, which went up by 17 percent after the group announced its decision. The prices continued to go up on Friday amid speculation that non-OPEC countries would agree to cuts. The projected reduction in oil production amounting to up to 1.8 billion b/d, that is set to follow the Saturday agreement and OPEC\\'s November decision, would account for about two percent of the current global oil supply.

              "  'Twenty civilians were killed in an attack on a restaurant in Dhaka’s diplomatic quarter on Friday, according to the Bangladeshi army. The victims were mainly foreigners. Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) has claimed responsibility for the attack. Bangladesh and its Western partners are concerned about a surge in terrorism in the country and have boosted measures to fight it. Last month, the US and Bangladesh signed a counter-terrorism agreement. RT: Are we seeing a surge in terrorism in Bangladesh now? Why do you think that is? Ahmed Quraishi: There is little question that ever since prime-minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed came to power in 2009, we are seeing here in this region a dramatic rise in extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh. This is very clear. And the most interesting part of this phenomenon is the reaction of the government itself, how effective the reaction of the PM Hasina Wazed government has been to these rising extremism. And I think this scorecard is really not very encouraging. We’ve seen the government, on the one hand, being very decisive against these groups in terms of the statements coming from government ministers and the actions on the ground. But at the same time, we have not seen those actions really translate into a reduction in these attacks. On the contrary, we are seeing a rise. So, there is a question that a lot of people are asking right now, and that is whether some of the actions, some of the high-handedness by the government of PM Hasina Wazed is actually contributing to the rise of extremism. And I am specifically\\xa0referring to the executions of some of the political opponents of the PM. Those trials were about the cases dated back to 1971, the independence of Bangladesh. But the very fact that those trials were conducted now, and the manner in which they were conducted, and the fact that most of the people who were executed belong to the religious groups – I think this is one key factor in this rising trend of extremism in Bangladesh under the reign of PM Hasina Wazed since 2009.\\xa0\\xa0 RT: The US is concerned about the situation in Bangladesh. Why? AQ: There is little question what we are seeing overall in this region. The Americans are basically concerned about the overall stability in South Asia mainly because of Afghanistan. And of course, the US has a growing relationship right now with India. In Bangladesh, the US is specifically concerned about rising Chinese influence…The US is very much interested in Bangladesh because of its strategic location, because of the fact that China is showing tremendous interest in Bangladesh. We are hearing\\xa0reports that the Chinese government is negotiating with the Bangladeshi government on a project that would see the establishment of some kind of sea port in Bangladesh that would facilitate trade between Bangladesh and China. So, the US is quite interested in Bangladesh, there is no question about it. Sultan M. Hali, senior retired officer of the Pakistani Air Force believes that such an attack was expected and links it to the recent execution of a number of officials from an Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami. “It was expected that there is going to be a backlash,” he told RT. RT: What do you think the US could do to help Bangladesh and its government fight terrorism? AQ: The US definitely can help the Bangladesh government in capacity building, Bangladesh needs that. But I must remind you that Bangladesh itself has a very disciplined army. It is one of the largest contributors to peace-keeping forces in Africa and in other regions of the world. Bangladesh is quite capable of handling the problem by itself as well.

The channel asked if the organizations in question are planning to investigate the claims of Turkish forces' atrocities against civilians there, and if any statements will be made. Ever since the military operation on the Kurdish population in the Cizre region began, members of the European Parliament have been addressing Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in open letters and public speeches, calling on him to put an end to the violence in Turkish regions inhabited by Kurds. “The objective of the Erdogan government is to completely have a genocidal campaign against the Kurds, because that’s what’s now occurring,” said Gregory Copley, editor of the journal Defense and Foreign Affairs. “This is now genocide, because the Turkish government has denied that there is any major military operation underway there.” The Turkish military has clearly been using “heavy ground weapons” in Cizre and “possibly even air weapons,” he added.  Commenting on the violence in Cizre, Kani Xulam, director of the American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN), accused Erdogan’s government of war crimes. “What the government of Turkey has done in Cizre is a war crime. They have attacked civilians who have not taken part in the fighting,” Xulam told RT, stressing that the Turkish military attacked Kurdish civilians that were not taking part in the fighting. “In a country that is aspiring to join the European Union and calls itself a member of NATO, you don’t target a whole town,” the expert said, adding that the “laws of war” imply making a distinction between civilians and belligerents. Tough Turkey: ‘Kurds fighting for their rights labeled as terrorists’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/pa8U1zdZ8opic.twitter.com/IzahzHMXcK According to data provided by the Turkish Human Rights Foundation, “178 civilians were deliberately targeted in three different basements and among some of the dead were children as young as nine to 10 years old…The government not only deliberately targeted and killed them, but also burned them. Some relatives were given piles of bones of their loved ones,” Xulam said. Xulam believes that Ankara’s offensive against the Kurds stems from the fact that Erdogan wants to be an uncontested “supreme leader” or “sultan” of Turkey, which the Kurdish population and its MPs strongly oppose. According to Xulam, Erdogan’s goal is to make the significant Kurdish ethnic minority (15 to 30 percent of Turkey’s population by various estimates) accept “inferior” status as “subjects,” and stop demanding language and cultural rights, as well as autonomy.

The operation in Cizre, which, according to Turkish Interior Minister Efkan Ala, was completed “in a very successful fashion,” officially ended early February.

Amnesty International reported in January that at least 150 civilians, women and children among them, had been killed in the Turkish military operation, saying that some 200,000 people had been put at risk and were being denied access to services due to strict curfews. “Cuts to water and electricity supplies combined with the dangers of accessing food and medical care while under fire are having a devastating effect on residents, and the situation is likely to get worse, fast, if this isn’t addressed,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia, as cited in the report. Pointing out the lax reaction to the human rights violations committed en mass by Turkish authorities against the Kurdish population, he urged the international community not to turn a blind on the conflict. “While the Turkish authorities appear determined to silence internal criticism, they have faced very little from the international community. Strategic considerations relating to the conflict in Syria and determined efforts to enlist Turkey’s help in stemming the flow of refugees to Europe must not overshadow allegations of gross human rights violations,” he added. \"],\n",

              "  'According to the latest poll conducted by the independent research center Levada, about 40 percent of Russians are concerned about ongoing international isolation of their country. In early March 2014, soon after the international sanctions against Russia were introduced for the first time, this share was significantly larger at 56 percent. However, the decrease of concerned Russians could be explained by the fact that currently 43 percent of respondents think that sanctions have only had an insignificant negative effect on the Russian economy, while another 20 percent said there was no negative effect at all. Only 29 percent of those polled believe that Western sanctions had caused a significant problem for Russia’s economy. READ MORE: 2 years on almost all Russians support reunification with Crimea Some 77 percent of respondents told Levada researchers they had personally experienced the effects of the economic crisis, but 70 percent said that the government and other senior authorities should continue the chosen course regardless of external economic and political pressure. Only 21 percent said that they supported negotiations with the West and a search for a mutually-acceptable solution that would allow the sanctions against Russia to be lifted. In the same poll, 58 percent of respondents said that they thought that reciprocal sanctions introduced by Russia were very effective because they afforded it more respect from foreign nations. Twenty-three percent said these restrictions were “senseless and absurd” and that they primarily hurt Russia’s own population. Levada head Lev Gudkov told Kommersant daily that the current outline in public opinion could be explained as the average citizen feeling that Russia is regaining its status as a great world power, and believing that international prestige is more important than the current economic situation. READ MORE: Russians list US, Ukraine & Turkey as country’s main enemies in latest poll The sanctions exchange started in mid-2014 as the US, EU and a number of their allies introduced sanctions against Russian companies and politicians over Russia’s alleged role in the Ukrainian political crisis and the accession of the Crimean Republic into the Russian Federation. In August 2014, the Russian government reciprocated with a ban on the import on meat, poultry, fish, cheese, milk, fruit and vegetables from the US, EU, Australia, Canada, Norway and other countries that had joined the initial Western sanctions. The ban was initially to last for a year, but was later prolonged until August 2016, and more recently until December 31, 2017, due to the unwillingness of the West to lift restrictions on Russia.

              "  'Board chair of the Our Children group, Yulia Zimova, said in an interview with Izvestia daily that according to official statistics Russia has about 70,000 orphans waiting to be adopted, and 20,000 registered couples who want to adopt a child. “Of course, the number of those who want to adopt is much bigger. Twenty thousand are just people who have some very particular wishes. For example, they want to take into their family a blue-eyed fair-haired girl under the age of three. But there are very few such children, the majority of kids in the existing ‘bank’ have various problems – they can be disabled, have brothers and sisters whom they don’t want to be separated from, or simply are older,” Zimova said. The possible solution to this problem is to create a state-run nationwide database of prospective parents. It would include anyone who approaches orphanages with a request to adopt, she said. Institutions all over Russia would then be able to offer the children in their care. This is currently very difficult. “The existing database is not perfect; there is no search system in it. It only has descriptions of prospective parents – to find candidates with particular features specialists have to personally read every file,” Zimova told Izvestia. READ MORE: Russian government drafts fresh bill facilitating domestic adoptions She noted that once the unified database is complete, it could make realistic proposals to would-be adopters.Zimova promised to put her proposals in a letter and send it to the Education and Science Ministry soon. Russian officials and activists started a campaign to boost domestic adoptions after a series of restrictions on international adoptions came into force over recent years. It started with the Dima Yakovlev Law that appeared on the statute books at the beginning of 2013. The law banned any adoption of Russian kids by US citizens or by proxy of US organizations. It was prompted by repeated US refusals to allow Russian diplomats and law enforcers to participate in the investigation of numerous cases of maltreatment, sexual exploitation and even killings of Russian children by US adoptive parents. In February 2014, the rules were tightened again when Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree banning the adoption of Russian children by foreign same-sex couples, as well as by unmarried citizens of countries where same-sex marriage is legal. In 2015, the Russian government introduced a series of tax benefits for citizens who adopted orphans and also streamlined some requirements for would-be adopters, making the procedure easier.

              "  \"After weeks of requests from multiple media outlets, thousands of pages of emails pertaining to the Laquan McDonald case have been released. The records dump took place on Thursday – New Year’s Eve – the start of a long holiday weekend when most people are more focused on celebrating. On October 20, 2014, 17-year-old McDonald was walking away from police while carrying a small knife when he was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke, who this week pled not guilty to murder charges following the release of a dashcam video last month. The IPRA is billed as a civilian agency within the city government. It is responsible for assessing police shootings, but many emails reveal that the agency coordinated its handling of the case with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s staff. Anti-violence protesters march through streets of Chicago on New Year Evehttps://t.co/EonYZ4cba4pic.twitter.com/xZ0wJGORnH On December 5, 2014, former IPRA chief Scott Ando emailed Janey Rountree, Deputy Chief of Staff for Public Safety, to provide a “list of cases pending review by either the [State Attorney’s Office] or the [US Attorney’s Office]” involving Chicago police misconduct. Ando also indicated which officers were being charged at the time. “In this case it was a status update on cases that were being reviewed by prosecutors for possible criminal investigation. The mayor’s office obviously does not direct investigations, nor are any employees involved in those investigations,” Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, told the Chicago Sun-Times. In another email to Rountree, Collins expressed frustration with the IPRA for not taking his advice when responding to a question from the media regarding McDonald. That May 26 email reads in part, “Against my recommendation, IPRA has already provided this response that was a little antagonistic. I’ve asked that they follow up with this as well to soften and reinforce their message,” while going on to provide a paragraph that played up IPRA’s investigatory powers and its independence. In an earlier email dated April 10 to Stephen Patton Collins, a top legal adviser to Mayor Emanuel, Collins had expressed more satisfaction with the IPRA. In that one he reported that Jeremy Gorner of the Chicago Tribune had “just asked IPRA about the McDonald settlement,” alluding to the $5 million civil payout to the McDonald family. “IPRA is giving him the statement we approved,” Collins wrote, going on to paste the two sentence statement. #Chicago announces 'fundamental' changes to police practices https://t.co/1LPTO4xErYpic.twitter.com/x8x5aoiebR On November 18, a week before the release of the dashcam footage showing McDonald’s killing, Collins emailed several representatives of police and law departments telling them, “we need one voice on this topic,” and then provided a “city statement” to provide talking points. “Here’s a first crack. I don’t think we should stray far from where we have been all along on this,” the email reads, before providing a draft of an official explanation as to why the video has yet to be released. The dump of internal emails has only fueled more criticism of Chicago’s government on social media and in the streets of Chicago, where protests calling for Emanuel’s resignation have not let up. Dozens of protesters gathered at Emanuel’s home for the third evening in a row on Thursday, promising to show up for at least another 13 days to symbolize the 16 gunshots McDonald took from police.

In one dated November 20, a campaign donor of Emanuel, Graham Grady, writes to Stephen Patton, one of Emanuel’s top advisers, offering to finance what could be described as controlled opposition. “Steve, I love Chicago and I’m concerned that the city may erupt when and if the video gets out,” Grady writes. “What if the Mayor and some community leaders such as Fr. Pfleger lead a peaceful demonstration with 100+ African-American youth wearing red mortar boards to symbolize education as the solution while also invoking the image of Laquan McDonald in a positive manner?” “You can get red mortar board caps for $10 bucks a piece. I’ll pay for 100 of them. Please let me know if I may be of assistance in helping in any way,” the email ends. \"],\n",

It was quiet for a little bit of time, but now it’s back in action and is back where it used to be and I’m happy to be a part of it or in the mix.” Stiverne has known of Povetkin since the two boxed for their respective countries in the amateur ranks, although they never actually boxed each other and the matchup between the two as professionals is of considerable intrigue to fans. The two fighters are considered among the most dangerous in the heavyweight division, with Stiverne\\xa0and Povetkin\\xa0have having registered a combined 43 knockouts from 59 professional fights. Povetkin is also a former world heavyweight champ. He won the WBA version of the title in 2011 and defended it four times before challenging Wladimir Klitschko for the lineal heavyweight championship, but was on the wrong end of a lopsided points decision, being knocked down four times in their 2013 fight in Moscow. It remains Povetkin’s only defeat, and since then he has racked up a total of four big knockout wins over world-ranked opposition, picking up the WBC International and WBC Silver heavyweight belts to land himself a shot at the interim world title. But despite their impressive experience, the two have been out of action for over a year - Stiverne since his November 2015 points victory over Derric Rossy and Povetkin since his 12th-round stoppage win over Mariusz Wach in the same month. Povetkin had been scheduled to fight Deontay Wilder for the title in in Moscow in May, but that fight fell through when the Russian tested positive for meldonium in the run-up to the bout. The WBC later cleared Povetkin in the doping case, opting not to ban him because of “the impossibility to scientifically prove that Mr. Povetkin ingested meldonium after January 1, 2016,” when the drug was included on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)’s list of forbidden substances. They instead ordered Povetkin to undergo self-funded testing for the next 12 months, with another failed test in that time frame seeing the fighter “indefinitely” suspended from all events organized by the WBC, the organization said in a statement.

              "  'During the sixth day of the ceasefire ... only the Syrian government troops have been actually observing the moratorium on combat operations,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Major-General Igor Konashenkov, said. Konashenkov criticized Washington once more for its unwillingness to force Syrian opposition groups that it has influence over to adhere to the terms of the ceasefire. “All our requests to the US side to provide contacts of \\'moderate oppositionists\\' or to influence them have been to no avail. On the contrary, the ... shelling of the Syrian government troops\\' positions ... is only growing, he said. The Americans have also failed to separate the ‘moderate’ opposition from terrorists as was agreed under the terms of the Syrian ceasefire, brokered by Moscow and Washington on September 9, the spokesman said. “After a week of ceasefire, it has become clear that the US side has neither influence nor even contacts with \\'moderate oppositionists\\' acting on the ground in Syria rather than in western capitals,” he added. According to Konashenkov, the most difficult situation is currently in Aleppo. \"Militants are using the ceasefire to lick wounds, recuperate and prepare for resumption of combat operations,\" he said. The jihadists are “pulling manpower and weapons in the areas they control, both during the day and at night,” capitalizing on the fact “that the government troops aren’t opening retaliatory fire,” he said. Objective control tools, other reconnaissance channels and accounts from civilians indicated the movement of fighters and a concentration of armored vehicles and cars in the eastern part of Aleppo and in the city’s suburbs. \"Such facts only prove our apprehension of regrouping of terrorist groups and their preparing large-scale combat operations,\" Konashenkov said.

Syrian president, Bashar Assad’s political and media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban, confirmed to RT that militants are taking advantage of the ceasefire. “Unfortunately, the terrorists regroup and rearm with every truce and with every cancellation of hostilities. And that’s because the US is hesitant to strike at the terrorists in Syria,” she told RT. The ceasefire in Syria was agreed during talks on September 9 as the sides agreed to influence the Syrian government and the so-called moderate rebel forces respectively in order to end hostilities. Since then, Moscow has repeatedly complained that Washington is failing to keep its part of the bargain. The US, on its part, has blamed Russia for not pressuring Damascus enough to facilitate humanitarian access to Syria. But the ceasefire was put at risk by the bombing of Syrian government forces by US-led coalition warplanes on Saturday. Some 62 soldiers were killed and 100 more wounded. Shaaban said it’s difficult to believe the US explanations, saying that “it would be very strange if a country like the US, which is supposed to be a No.1 in military power in the world, makes such a mistake.” “The Syrian army was over few hills and the American strikes… came over all these hills and the moment the American planes struck the Syrian army the terrorist came from the same side,” she said. According to Assad’s adviser, it was “obvious to everyone in the field that there was an obvious coordination between the American planes and the terrorists.” She also pointed out the fact that the American planes stopped shelling the area where the Syrian army was as soon as it was occupied by Islamic State militants.

Commons leader David Lidington said: “I can confirm this morning that, while the government found the analysis of Lord Strathclyde compelling, and we are determined that the principle of the supremacy of the elected House should be upheld, we have no plans for now to introduce new primary legislation.” Under Strathclyde’s proposals, peers would have been limited to asking the lower chamber to reconsider planned legislation, leaving the final decision to the Commons.

They believe this would help Russia to better fulfill its obligations within the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body it joined in 2003 that aims to combat illegal financial practices. READ MORE: Get rid of it or leave: Russian Parliament approves ban on foreign assets for MPs, top officials “The work to introduce the concept of PEP into Russian law will consist of several stages. On the first stage, we will submit the motion obliging all parliamentarians to declare the income and property of their ex-spouses for five years after the divorce. Later we will develop and draft everything else,” Solovyov told reporters. The lawmakers also told the newspaper they had noticed a direct correlation between the number of divorces among elected officials and the recent toughening of Russian anti-corruption laws. According to Solovyov and Pozdnyakov, since the ban on foreign assets for civil servants came into force in 2013 the number of divorces among lower house MPs has surged. In 2011 there were 77 single lawmakers in the 450-seat State Duma, in 2014 the number was 99, and in 2015 it reached 102. The Communists claim that many of the divorced couples continued to live together and therefore the sole purpose of separation was an attempt to bypass the law – which they succeeded in doing. Earlier this year, Russia’s Communist and Liberal Democratic parties drafted bills that forbid people whose relatives are engaged in business activities to assume official posts, and banned children of civil servants from entrepreneurship. The posts that fall under the limitation are described as “senior or head position in a state agency” and also in all cases when the responsibilities of the official include overseeing or control over businesses of his or her relatives. However, the State Duma rejected the motion in the first reading. READ MORE: Opposition parties draft bills banning civil servants’ relatives from business activities In 2013, Russia introduced a law banning senior state officials from holding bank accounts abroad or owning foreign-issued shares and bonds.

One such famous saying was “Homosexuality is not a perversion. Field hockey and ballet on ice are,” and activists intended to carry slogans with this phrase at their event. The other court decision dealt with the official ban on the gay pride parade in Kostroma in June 2014. One of the best-known figures in the Russian LGBT movement, Alekseyev has repeatedly attempted to organize gay pride events in various parts of the country, but with no success. Usually the authorities refuse the required license for such events over fears of potential conflicts between their participants and ordinary citizens. In addition, Russian law currently forbids the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to minors and the format of street march or picket does not allow for control of children’s access to the event.

Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at University of Kent, says UKIP is distracted by the referendum, but there remain unresolved questions, such as how the party will remedy infighting. “UKIP needs to decide where it wants to go in the event of a Remain vote. “Does the party carry on as usual or does it instead try to mobilize something more significant, perhaps through a rebrand and potentially a new leader?” Goodwin asks. \"],\n",

Germany doesn’t have strict laws concerning the amount of cash foreigners can bring in and out. The government’s attempt to ratify a law that limits a single cash transaction to €5,000, failed in February after meeting public discontent. Some Germans regarded the bill as an attempt by Berlin to get into their private affairs rather than tackle money laundering. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported about a crime ring that managed to launder at least €5 million in Germany. The ring earned the money by selling heroin in Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and the UK and laundered the money in Germany by buying expensive used cars and farm equipment and reselling it in the Middle East.

              "  'The 11-minute clip, which has been leaked on social media, has the glossy production qualities and watermarks consistent with previous execution videos posted by the jihadist group.As its centerpiece, it features a narration from a man with British-Asian accent, reading out a scripted jeremiad directed towards Prime Minister David Cameron and the UK, which began to bomb IS positions inside Syria in the past month. The evil and disgusting ISIS propaganda video shows why we need to do much more to tackle radicalisation in Britain. https://t.co/fAd73IwloS The balaclava-clad man stands over the kneeling victims clad, who are wearing orange jumpsuits, as he accuses Cameron of being a “slave of the White House, and mule of the Jews” threatening IS with a “handful” of planes. The unidentified executioner strains to emulate the style of Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, who was reportedly killed last November by a drone strike. The speaker then says that IS will invade Britain, claiming that Cameron will do nothing to save those “fighting under his banner on minimum wages.” He illustrates his point by appearing to shoot one of the captives in the head, though with the edit it is unclear if it is he taking the fatal shot. Four other terrorists standing behind each of the hostages then simultaneously unload their guns into the victims. It ends with a small boy in an army uniform shouting “We will kill kuffir [infidels] over there,” and a promise of another video. As is revealed in stilted taped confessions at the start of the clip, two of the executed men say they discreetly filmed footage and took photos in Raqqa, the IS stronghold in northern Syria, which were subsequently shown in the Western media. The other three admit to being paid to provide information to intelligence services.All five men, who say they are between the ages of 25 and 40, call themselves apostates, and ask to be re-admitted into Islam.British intelligence says it is examining the authenticity of the tape, but will not comment on whether the featured victims ever worked undercover for the UK, as is its policy. It is also attempting to figure out the identity of the new executioner through electronic communications. They also will try to determine whether the child in the video is British, or a local coached to say a phrase in English. There are thought to be 300 UK citizens fighting in Islamic State’s ranks in the Middle East. In 2015 the #GlobalCoalition has liberated towns and communities from #Daesh control #CoalitionProgress2015pic.twitter.com/IftkVPaYiC The Foreign Office has said that the new video is “propaganda” meant to distract IS supporters from “its recent military failings in Iraq and its inability to look after people in the areas that it controls.”Islamic State has been subject to a constant aerial barrage from two different international coalitions, one led by the US and Saudi Arabia, and another by Russia and Syria. It has also recently suffered territorial setbacks, as ground troops in Syria and Iraq have staged successful counter-offensives. '],\n",

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  'Bestselling writer Forsythe was addressing an audience at the Edinburgh Book Festival when he made the remarks. He said he had been told by the BBC, for whom he worked at the time, that his reporting of the 1962-1970 struggle by the country’s Biafran minority to secede from Nigeria was biased. He claimed that because his reports were unacceptable to the British state – which armed the Nigerians during the war – his political leanings came under scrutiny. He then decided to cover the war as an independent journalist. “I got my own ticket to Portugal and conned an arms dealer into taking me into Biafra and while I was there someone entered my flat,” the Day of the Jackal author said. “They said to the neighbors that we had concerns for my health ... the door was duly beaten in.” Asked exactly who had kicked his door in, Forsythe said: “It was the BBC. I was told there is a very secretive fellow in the BBC called ‘The Investigator.’” “They were terrified because the BBC had had a correspondent who had defected and it caused a huge scandal. Very, very embarrassing, so just in case there were any other backsliders they had a man to investigate the politics,” he explained. Forsythe, who recently admitted that he himself engaged in intelligence work for the British state while a journalist, had withering words about the UK establishment. He told the audience he preferred “to be an outsider looking in because as far as I can tell most of the establishment are b*stards and I don’t want to join them.” The BBC had been very much a part of the country’s power structures as an arm of the “establishment ... not a news organisation,” he said.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"These were just three of the important topics up for discussion at this week’s Fifth St. Petersburg International Cultural Forum. The Forum constituted 275 separate events across 92 venues in Russia’s magnificent Northern capital (its beauty enhanced by seasonal snow and ice) and involved cultural activists and participants from all over the world. On Friday night, at the new Mariinsky Theater, which opened in 2013, a special gala looked back at the Year of Cinema in Russia, and told the story of the renaissance of the Russian film industry. The event began with a welcoming address by President Vladimir Putin\\xa0and also included celebrated British actor Ralph Fiennes, who, speaking in Russian, told how since childhood he had been inspired by Russian culture. ‘Whatever happens in politics, we have deep connection in culture' - actor Ralph Fiennes to RThttps://t.co/ouJCANCJ3X The 125th anniversary of the birth of composer Sergey Prokofiev was commemorated with extracts from Sergey Eisenstein’s 1944 epic movie Ivan the Terrible, for which Prokofiev wrote the score. The fiftieth anniversary of the classic seven-hour long, Oscar-winning Soviet production of War and Peace, for many judges the best film version of Tolstoy’s work, was also marked with a dance and video display. The message from this and other events was evident. Russia remains open to outside influence and is promoting its own culture with a renewed sense of pride and enthusiasm, something that was totally lacking in the morale-sapping years of Boris Yeltsin. Then the film industry and arts were left to sink or swim as the government, and corrupt Western-backed oligarchs plundered the public purse. For instance, the LenFilm studio, which produced so many classics in the Soviet era, is once again thriving, after being near to closure. Under a government program, thousands of small picture houses in towns and villages, originally built by the Communists, have been modernized with the latest cinema technology. However, even though state support for Russian films has increased – it must be said, it’s still way below the level of subsidy the industry received in Soviet times. And there remains the all-important question, what sort of films should Russia be making? There were calls for the government to fund productions more in tune with Russian ’philosophy’ and not just ’Americanized’ blockbusters. The topic of cultural renewal was also covered during a one-day discussion panel held at the 18th century Herzen State Pedagogical University, entitled: ‘National and global culture and education development patterns in the framework of state sovereignty.' The issue of ’language imperialism’ - and attempts to impose a cross-borders cultural hegemony by a few Anglo-Saxon countries was raised by some the distinguished speakers. There was also criticism of the ‘Bologna Process’ which had been designed to try and achieve comparability of academic standards across Europe. Professor Kira V. Preobrazhenskaya complained that for Russian scholars to publish internationally in English-language journals, they have to criticize Russian culture. Vardan E. Bagdasaryan, Chair of History, Political Sciences and Law at Moscow State Regional University, said education and culture were, unfortunately, part of a new ‘war,' and that Anglo-Saxon journals which purport to be ’objective’ are very often biased, promoting a Western-centric view of history and also Russophobia. Dimitri de Kochko, of the Union of Russophones of France, called for Russia to follow the example of Hollywood and the Disney Corporation and do all it could to build Russophone networks as a counter to the prevailing Western Russophobia. He noted that in the current climate in France and elsewhere in the West one can get away with saying racist things about Russians that would get the speaker into serious trouble if said about other ethnicities. Even great Russian writers like Fyodor Dostoyevsky were coming under attack for geopolitical reasons. In my speech, I discussed cultural\\xa0‘dumbing down’\\xa0in the age of neo-liberalism and argued that this process was no accident but a deliberate policy of the West’s ruling elite, who, while keeping the best arts for themselves, wanted to create a population of docile, materialistic consumers. Aldous Huxley had meant Brave New World to be a warning; the powers-that-be seem to be using it as a blueprint. I also contrasted the more balanced cross-border cultural exchanges which took place in the more egalitarian pre-neoliberal era, with today, when Hollywood and other organs of Western\\xa0‘soft power’\\xa0have become far too dominant. To illustrate the point, I read from the BBC television listings from Christmas 1978, which included films and programs from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. Contrast that real internationalism and open-mindedness to today, when rabidly anti-Russian neocons in the West are doing all they can to try and get RT taken off the air, and the programs we see about Russia, outside of RT, are almost always negative. Professor Lubov M. Mosolova, a Doctor of Culturology at Herzen University, warned against having a too narrow view of ‘culture,' saying it includes far more than the arts. We can speak of an engineering culture, an Army culture and the culture of the workplace. The word ‘artists’ needs to be broadened too, as many workers and not just actors, painters, film/theater directors and dancers, are artists. At the end of the day’s proceedings, a resolution was adopted. It noted that globalization entails not only the interpenetration of national cultures but often jeopardized the cultural identity of countries and peoples. The panel put forward some recommendations, which included Russia’s Ministry of Education and Science forming a public-professional expert group on the analysis of the current educational situation and an international youth cultural and education camp being held in St. Petersburg in the summer of 2017. To protect and preserve national heritage and sovereign education systems in the era of globalization certainly presents many challenges but genuine humanitarians, who oppose the elites of a few countries trying to impose a dumbed-down cultural hegemony on others, will have been encouraged by what they saw and heard in St. Petersburg last week. The inspiring and life-enhancing city of Dostoyevsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Shostakovich, as well as of many others, in both the narrower and broader sense referred to by Lubov Mosolova, shows us the way to go. And not for the first time. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"],\n",

              "  'Following the murder on Monday evening, French authorities were criticized for allegedly failing to do more about the jihadist Larossi Abballa. He had been known to police since 2011 and in 2013 he had been sentenced to three years in prison, with six months suspended, for his role in a recruitment network of Islamist radicals to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Abballa was on a French monitoring list, was under police surveillance and his phone was tapped since February, according to prosecutors, but there were reportedly no signs of an attack being planned. Several right-wing politicians, including Eric Ciotti, a member of Les Republicains [The Republicans] party, urged the French authorities to establish facilities for people with dangerous mental health issues and who are known to police. “We need to deal with the issue of these people who are identified, known [to police] and followed… Abballa was one of those people. Since 2012, I’ve placed multiple propositions to create a closed retention center where all the high-risk, ‘time-bomb’ people could be put,” Ciotti said. The leader of Les Republicains, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, also supported\\xa0a security step-up in prisons in an interview given to Le Figaro newspaper. “We’re at a state of war. It’s an external war against groups [like] ISIS and Al-Qaeda, but also an internal one against those French citizens who support radical Islam,” he said, adding that “jihadism and radical Islamism are our real enemies, and they sustain each other.” The move to open the detention facilities was supported by a Muslim leader, Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. \"Individuals like this are moving around freely in France. This should not last,\" he said.Others like presidential candidate Alain Juppé called for radicalized individuals to be put under house arrest. In his latest comments, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the idea of retention centers could threaten the letter of law. \"Our first weapon is criminal law, and it is the legitimacy of the rule of law: to pursue, detain and put out of harm\\'s way all those who engage in these [jihadist] networks. [It can be] dangerous to confuse measures of surveillance with those of confinement.” “We can learn the lessons of this terrorist threat but we can’t invent new measures each time,” he added. He also defended the security forces, saying in an interview with France Inter radio on Wednesday: “I will not let anyone say there was any negligence or lack of judgment.” A system of detention for suspected Islamists already exists in several French prisons. Several dozen of the most radical inmates are determined by using a set of questions, and they are then grouped together behind bars to prevent them from spreading their ideas. The system has been criticized for uniting the jihadists, though. The latest news comes a day after Belgian security services informed their French counterparts about groups of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) fighters coming to Europe from Syria. \"We know there are fighters who are coming back [to Europe],\" French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told a news conference Wednesday. However, French authorities remained “very cautious” about the alert, as they frequently get such notes, AP quoted their source as saying. The Euro 2016 football tournament is taking place in France and has seen security stepped up dramatically.

The suspects are five men from Chechnya and they all face charges of a contract murder within a criminal group and illegal possession of firearms. READ MORE: Nemtsov murder mastermind named Markin added that the committee had started a separate case against suspected organizer of the hit Ruslan Mukhutdinov and his yet-unidentified possible accomplices. Mukhutdinov was put on international wanted lists in November 2015 after a Russian court found enough grounds to issue an order for his arrest. In late December 2015, the head of the Investigative Committee Aleksandr Bastrykin told the press that his agency had pressed final charges against the suspected murderers of Nemtsov and the suspected organizer of the hit. He noted that the suspects’ complicity in the killing had been confirmed by over 70 forensic experiments, testimonies of witnesses, CCTV records and many documents seized at the suspects’ places of residence.

In February 2015 Nemtsov was shot dead on a Moscow street near the Kremlin. The assassination prompted a thousands-strong march in the Russian capital, with demands to find and punish the killers. In early March, police detained the four men suspected of carrying out the attack and according to Russian mass media, one of the detained, Zaur Dadaev, told investigators that the murder was revenge for Nemtsov’s “negative comments on Muslims and Islam,” in particular, the public condemnation of Islamists who killed the journalists from Charlie Hebdo magazine in France. Dadayev retracted his testimony a short time later and now denies any involvement in the case, along with the rest of the suspects. Nemtsov’s relatives have wanted the case to be re-qualified as ‘the murder of a state official’, but a district court in Moscow denied this request, saying that law enforcers had failed to find any ties between the killing and Nemtsov’s political activities.

              "  'The organization has published a report Making the Case: The Dangers of Killer Robots and the Need for a Preemptive Ban, ahead of the Conference of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), beginning December 12. The CCW is made up of 121 countries, which will decide by consensus on December 16 whether deliberations on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) will continue in 2017 and, if so, how these talks will progress. Fully-autonomous weapons can independently seek, identify and attack targets. The HRW has voiced concern that some of the member countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Israel, Russia, and South Korea are developing weapons systems with growing levels of autonomy The Pentagon allocated US$18 billion of its latest budget to develop systems and technologies that could form the basis of fully-autonomous weapons, according to The New York Times. US Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work said that this was in response to China and Russia’s development of killer robots. Work said last year it was important for the US to \"dominate\" machine learning and artificial intelligence to counteract the emerging threats posed by China and Russia. via GIPHY Bonnie Docherty, senior arms researcher at Human Rights Watch will present the report at UN offices in Geneva on December 14. It comes on the back of a campaign launched by HRW and other NGOs \\xa0more than three years ago - Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. This has resulted in three informal meetings about these lethal autonomous weapons by CCW states since 2014. “Governments should ensure that humans retain control over whom to target with their weapons and when to fire,” Docherty said. “The success of past disarmament treaties shows that an absolute prohibition on fully-autonomous weapons would be achievable and effective,” Docherty added. Bonnie Docherty on killer robots and why need a global ban. Dangers are not a joke, people. https://t.co/2cKTwcylL6pic.twitter.com/8PoCdrhGDY The report, co-published with Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic, examined “the legal, moral, security, and other dangers of killer robots” and concluded that a ban is the only option for addressing all of the concerns. It recommended the adoption of an international treaty prohibiting the development, production and use of fully-autonomous weapons, noting this would help clarify existing international humanitarian law in relation to the matter. It also advised that formal discussions and national policies establishing prohibition of weapons should be initiated. Briefing by @ICRC for #CCWUN urges states to set limits on autonomy in weapon systems, substantive progress via GGE https://t.co/neIe06Yq39pic.twitter.com/AaDfb2rpFi The report responded to 16 key arguments made against banning the lethal autonomous weapons, including the assertion that regulation would be more effective than an all out ban. “A binding, absolute ban on fully-autonomous weapons would reduce the chance of misuse of the weapons, would be easier to enforce, and would enhance the stigma associated with violations,” the report contended. Researchers also argued that fully-autonomous weapons puts civilians and soldiers at risk as they would lack emotions, including compassion and a resistance to killing. A University at Buffalo research team published a paper last month suggesting a ban on \\xa0\"killer robots\" may only be a temporary solution and the focus should shift from the technological developments to the cultural and political motivations behind them.

A number of years later, Flo moved into Bill’s house and the two were inseparable. \"I guess it\\'s a bit odd for two old biddies like us to get married,\" Flo told ITV. \"Bill\\'s a really loving and helpful man.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Turkey intensified a crackdown against Kurdish militants in recent weeks following a PKK terror attack in Ankara that killed 28 people. Turkish authorities insist all those killed during police raids are terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers party [PKK.] There have also been several reports that Iraqi Kurds have shot down a helicopter which they claim had been used in air strikes against them. RT:\\xa0Turkey seems determined to proceed with its military crackdown despite the outcry from rights groups. Do you think they will admit they killed thousands of civilians? Ronald Suny: I doubt that very much. The fact is that at the moment all over the world, and in Turkey particularly right now, the word ‘terrorist’ has become meaningless – that is, anyone who resists oppression, occupation they are being called ‘terrorists’ nowadays. The people who have been fighting or defending their towns in Diyarbakir, in Cizre have been fighting for autonomy, for some rights. In Kurdistan, that is, in Eastern Turkey, it is impossible for a Kurdish child to be educated in a state school in the Kurdish language. We’re talking about 15 million or more people who cannot study in their own language. This is clearly oppression, it is against national self-determination, and it is extremely reprehensible what the Turkish government has decided to do against its own Kurdish citizens. RT:\\xa0We've seen pictures from the areas under curfew and they literally look like Syria at the moment. How come such heavy military operations are being allowed in residential areas? RS: I think this is really reprehensible. The level of warfare in these internal conflicts is going to new degrees of obscenity, it seems to me: bombing from the air civilian populations in cities where they have really no escape, or in the case of the Cizre, surrounding the town with tanks, shelling the civilians, and the people who are defending the towns, of course they are called ‘militants, terrorists’ or whatever. Sniping from rooftops on people who go out to help other people who have been wounded. These kinds of things have become daily occurrences. It seems at the moment in Cizre the fighting has stopped, the Turkish army has taken over the city. As you saw in Diyarbakir, demonstrations to try to protest what has been going on have also been broken up. So at the very moment it seems that the Turkish government and armed forces have the upper hand in what is essentially a struggle by the Kurds – not for independence, so much - as for some autonomy, some recognition of their existence of their rights within the Turkish state. The image Turkey wants to give to the world, especially to the Kurds, is that they cannot be beaten, the Kurds should submit to them, Kani Xulam of the American Kurdish Information Network, told RT. RT:\\xa0If such an incident took place why do you think the Turkish government is staying quiet about it? Kani Xulam: Well, the Turkish government would like to portray itself as invincible, as a power that cannot be beaten. Throughout the conflict with the Kurds, scores of Turkish soldiers were taken prisoners and the Turkish government would not even acknowledge them for long periods of time. And when there were peace talks these soldiers would be released. About the helicopter incident – in the Turkish media there is no reference to it, but there are some references now in some of the Kurdish dailies about it. But the image Turkey wants to give to the world, especially to the Kurds, is that they cannot be beaten; the Kurds should submit to them, go down on their knees. But this generation of Kurds is not about going down on their knees, they want to fight back, they want to get their rights. RT:\\xa0Turkey has been targeting Kurdish forces in many areas outside the country. Why does it feel entitled to conduct such operations on another states' territory? KH: The problem is the Kurds live in Syria, in Iraq, in Turkey and in Iran. For a long time these countries, even if they didn’t go along on a lot of issues, they will go along on the Kurdish issue. When [Saddam] Hussein was in power, for example, Turkey had a green light, if you will. It could fly into Iraqi Kurdistan and fight the Kurds [Turkish Kurds] at will. With the advent of the Arab Spring things have changed. Any time now, for example, Turkey attacks Kurdish positions inside Iraq, the Arab League condemns it, the Baghdad government condemns it. Turkish–Syrian relations are not good now. So anytime Turkey wants to attack the Kurds inside Syria, the Syrian government condemns it. Their relations lately have become soured, but for a long time they were good. The good part was that the common denominator was that they all didn’t like the Kurds and they wanted the Kurds not to prosper.

For example, bluish blotches are for plains, while purple indicates mountains, and pink is for scattered hills. “Producing such maps is important for gauging what processes have operated where on Pluto, and when they occurred relative to other processes at work,” NASA says. “By studying how the boundaries between units crosscut one another, mission scientists can determine which units overlie others, and assemble a relative chronology for the different units.” #Pluto space slugs?

Lebanese-based Al Mayadeen channel reports that dozens of military vehicles already have crossed from Turkey into Syria. According to Reuters the forces are made up of Failaq al Sham, Sultan Murad, Ahrar al-Sham and Jabha al Shamiya units. The assault is expected to begin in the next few days before Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) can retake the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) -held town. A US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters are also making a push towards the border town after taking full control of Manbij by driving IS militants from the strategically important town, used by terrorists to smuggle weapons and goods. The SDF already controls the eastern bank of the Euphrates opposite Jarablus. Ankara has long been worried about the autonomy of Kurds in Syria as Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) of the Democratic Union Party of Syria (PYD) with the help of American-led airstrikes, continue to capture vast amount of territory in Northern Syria, which borders Kurdish-dominant southeastern Turkey, where Ankara has engaged the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK) in a brutal military campaign for over a year. Turkey has repeatedly said that it would not tolerate Kurds staying west of the Euphrates River, with YPG-PYD advances in northern Syria remaining the key security issue for Ankara. The two groups are designated terrorist organizations by Turkey but not the US. Turkey fears that Kurds are trying to link up Afrin canton with its cantons in the east, Kobane and Cizre. On Saturday the Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim vowed that Ankara will play a “more active” role in Syria in the next six months. “We say the bloodshed needs to stop. Babies, children, innocent people should not die. That’s why Turkey will be more active in trying to stop the danger getting worse in the next six months, compared with before,” Yildirim told reporters in Istanbul.

Twelve percent of respondents found the question too complicated to answer. When the pollsters mentioned the anti-Russian sanctions introduced by Western nations and their allies after Crimea’s accession into the Russian Federation, 75 percent of respondents said they thought Crimea was just an excuse for this move and the West had intended to introduce sanctions against their country by any means. Twenty percent agreed that without reunification there would have been no sanctions and five percent could not give a simple answer to this question.

However, when the Russian Ministry of Defense addressed the leadership of the UN watchdog OPCW “with the demand to urgently send its experts to Aleppo to participate in the sample analysis,” the organization “refused to carry out this simple task, citing security issues.” The underlying reason behind this, Lavrov said, seemed to be “tremendous pressure from our Western colleagues,”\\xa0because “our and Syrian sides guaranteed security [for the experts].” Russia is now working on the possibility of delivering the samples for analysis to The Hague, Lavrov added. “It will make it hard [for them] to back out,” the minister said, as quoted by TASS. Lavrov’s statement comes a day after the Ministry of Defense spoke about the evidence of chemical attacks by rebels, and stressed that the OPCW was refusing to cooperate. Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov said that Russian experts collected bioassays from four Syrians injured in the attacks, and made the shocking discovery earlier this month. Responding to media inquiries about the matter, the OPCW spokesperson confirmed that the organization had \"recently received an offer from Russian authorities to provide some samples and other material in relation to an incident of alleged use of chemicals as weapons in Aleppo.\" Yet, citing \"security situation in and around Aleppo,\" the watchdog said it expected \"to receive such material in Damascus or The Hague.\" In fact, Russian top brass has been warning since September that the militants might use chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo, and in October, Syrian state media reported toxic gas having been used against a government-held area in the city. Fifteen people were injured back then, and a local doctor told RT that the symptoms could be those observed after the use of chlorine gas. Over the past few years, the Syrian government has often come under fire over claims of its alleged use of chemical weapons to attack the rebel-held areas – from activists and the UN, as well as the US State Department.

Initial reports on the attack came on Friday, with AFP citing local officials and medics as saying that 15 women were killed and 50 more injured. Konashenkov noted that such incidents bear the mark of war crimes. “These deadly attacks on civilian areas, which have all the marks of war crimes, are becoming almost a daily routine for the international coalition.” The spokesman also noted that civilians and civilian infrastructure are increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs of the coalition bombardment.\\xa0 “Too often weddings, funerals, hospitals, police stations, and humanitarian convoys are being hit by the coalition warplanes,” Konashenkov said.\\xa0Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova also weighed in, slamming the coalition’s action. “Yesterday the ‘human rights defenders’ again bombed a funeral ceremony, this time in the Iraqi Daquq where there are no terrorists.” Zakharova said in a Facebook post. In a statement to RT, the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF), which is in charge of the international anti-ISIS operation in Iraq and Syria, said that it has no evidence that jets of the alliance carried out the Daquq strike. “At this time, we cannot associate this incident with any Coalition strikes in the area,” the response says.

At least 80 people, died in the fighting while\\xa0some 170 have been injured, according to AP. The attack on Kirkuk comes at a time when the Iraqi military is conducting a full-scale military operation to retake the country’s second-largest city, Mosul from the jihadists.

In general it went well, but we also encountered some problems and presently we are preparing some legislative proposals that would correct the revealed drawbacks,” the source added. READ MORE: High alert: Russia tests army’s readiness in massive snap exercise in west & south In particular, the military wants to switch completely from the previous scheme, under which in times of war all regional authorities and federal ministries worked on their own dedicated tasks and the Defense Ministry only had a coordinating role. The new rules of wartime administration would give all administrative powers to the military, which would issue direct commands to regional authorities, law enforcers, rescuers and the National Guard. Russia currently has five military districts that comprise the Defense Ministry’s territory division units. In times of war, the command of each of these districts will be divided into two parts – the Operative Strategic Command and the Wartime Military District. The former will be in charge of military operations and the latter will control the draft, logistics and execution of all special regime measures, such as maintaining public order and the increased security of strategic installations and communications. The new system was tested in southern Russia’s Stavropol Region, Ingushetia and Crimea. Military sources also told reporters that all the proposed changes are in line with the 2016-2020 Plan of Defense signed by President Vladimir Putin in November 2015.

              "  'The Spectator ran two articles on Russia in its latest issue, with the first piece by Paul Wood speculating if Moscow was trying to trick the world into thinking it is planning an invasion of the Baltic States. In the second entry, Rod Liddle urged the West to stop saber rattling against Russia, and suggested that Putin is on top in the propaganda war. “Our readers are very interested in Putin,” Gray told RT.\\xa0\\xa0“We have two articles in this issue that look at the matter of Putin, the matter of the Baltic States and also Syria, and, generally, the Western hysteria towards Russia, which we, in the office, all feel is very unhelpful to the West. It’s obviously a good selling subject for us, but it doesn’t mean that we’re covering it in a biased way.” According to him, The Spectator finds itself in a unique position of “not being Russophobic, but also not being Russophilic.” The British journalist said the Western “hysteria” about Russia can be explained by “some deep psychic need for an enemy, which Putin is filling very neatly for us at the moment.” “A lot of it might be to do with the American election. Hillary Clinton is going to come in very soon, it looks like,” he said. Gray added that “American and British hawks are getting hysterical” due to Clinton being one of the people who are whipping up aggression against Putin. As for the leaks of the DNC and Podesta emails, the Clinton team “are very, very keen to pin the blame on Russia as the [releases by] WikiLeaks are embarrassing to the Democrats. So, if they can say that: ‘Nobody should be talking about this. We shouldn’t give the enemy an advantage,’ obviously that’s advantageous to them,” he said. He stressed that when it comes to cyber security “there does seem to be quite a lot of activity coming from Russia,” but added that the West has no concrete proof against Moscow. Claims that the Russian government is somehow meddling with the outcome of the US presidential election are a manifestation of the same hysteria, Gray said. The journalist predicted that after all of Clinton’s rhetoric about Russia “there’s going to be some kind of showdown over the no-fly zone in Syria. And that’s’ a very frightening prospect.” He said it’s “silly on our part to provoke Putin,” adding that the Russian leader is “going to advance Russia’s national interest and that may mean some sort of confrontation in eastern Europe.” READ MORE: It’s Russia & RT! Team Clinton knows who’s to blame for Podesta leaks Gray expressed the belief that “the more people that can say how hysterical we’re being in the West [about Russia] – the better. And that we were trying to do this week in The Spectator.’” He also commented on the recent attempt to close RT’s bank accounts in UK, saying that such developments pose a “great danger.” “We’re so afraid of these threats to our free society from the East that we’re actually in danger of not being a free society ourselves… I think you do spread propaganda on your channel. I think you do. But we’re a free society and we should allow you to do it,” he said. According to The Spectator deputy editor, Russia and Putin are “winning the information war. It seems his propaganda is rather superior to ours. And we seem to be losing on many fronts.” When asked about the different tone in which the Western media covers similar operations in Mosul by the US-led coalition in Iraq and in Aleppo by Russia in Syria, he said that “there are huge double standards in Western media. There are huge double standards in Eastern media, I’m sure. And even on such an honest channel as RT.” READ MORE: Pro-Hillary US State Dept ‘behind Assange internet cutoff’ – WikiLeaks activist to RT “There’s double standards in Yemen too.

              "  'In its latest study, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) found that advances in arms technology that were once the preserve of the West are becoming increasingly accessible to states worldwide. The study, which is titled “Military Balance 2016,” examines the military and defense spending capabilities of 171 countries across the globe. It is released annually by the think tank and is viewed as an important resource in the field of defense and security policy-making. The IISS found that cruise missiles, unmanned drones and technology used for the purpose of electronic warfare are no longer accessible merely to Western states, but have also become available to governments worldwide. The report said the number of states known to operate unmanned drones had doubled since 2011, with China exporting them to allied states such as Iraq and Nigeria. The report went on to make a number of controversial claims about Russian, Asian and NATO defense spending. It said a rise in the Kremlin’s defense budget for 2015 sparked a 20 percent increase in military spending worldwide, while Asia spends almost $100 billion more on defense than NATO’s European members.\\xa0 The report also noted the number of army battalions in the most prominent NATO states and in America had plunged from 649 to 185 since 2001. Meanwhile, British combat aircraft numbers were found to have fallen from 475 to 194 since 1991, while French warplanes were found to have plummeted from 579 to 271. Speaking at a London press conference, IISS Director General John Chipman warned the West’s 20-year military superiority in technological terms is dwindling. “Slowing this emerging trend or reversing it will be a key preoccupation of Western strategists in the coming decade,” he said. The IISS report said Britain is attempting to remain ahead of the curve by developing a solar-powered surveillance drone, while the US is working on sophisticated electronics for unmanned aerial vehicles. “ISIS [Islamic State/IS, also known as ISIL], and the groups around the world that have pledged allegiance to it, cannot be eradicated solely by military means,” the report said. “Tackling these groups will require multinational attention and the concerted and long-term application of policies and tools blending political, military, security, information, and development capacities, and agreement on ends as well as means.” '],\n",

              "  'In short, Washington and its allies want regime change, while Russia and Iran insist that President Bashar Assad and his government are the legitimate ruling authorities in Syria. All sides are mandated by UN resolutions to respect the sovereign will of the Syrian people – to determine the political future of their country. But the Western powers and their regional partners, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar in particular, are insisting – explicitly or implicitly – on their objective of ousting Assad. This premise of unlawful interference in the affairs of a sovereign state is the crux of the problem, and why the latest seeming agreement for a nationwide truce is as thin as the paper it is written on. US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\\xa0announced\\xa0the proposal for a cessation of hostilities following six hours of negotiations with 15 other member states belonging to the International Syria Support Group in Munich last Friday. The truce is supposed to come into effect later this week. The truce outlined in an ISSG communique does not apply to two militant groups: Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIL/ISIL or Daesh) and the Jabhat al Nusra Front. Both are linked to Al Qaeda and are officially listed by international governments as terrorist organizations. The provision also exempts “other terror groups” but does not specify the names. This is a major loophole in the proposed truce deal which will make its application extremely problematic if not infeasible. That loophole also alludes to the foreign-backed nature of the conflict in Syria. Following the Munich communique, the Syrian government and its Russian ally both said that their combined military operations against terror groups would continue. President Assad\\xa0vowed\\xa0that his armed forces were moving ahead with their offensive, backed by Russian air power, to “retake the whole country.” He said the battle for the northern city of Aleppo – the country’s largest – was crucial to “cut off terrorist supply routes from Turkey.” Given the delineation of terror groups in the Munich communique and in recent UN resolutions (2249 and 2254), it would appear incontestable that the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies have every right to maintain the military momentum. Yet Syria and Russia’s continued offensive around Aleppo over the weekend provoked recriminations from Western powers. Western media coverage tended to portray the continuation of military operations as a bad faith breach of the tentative truce. Reuters\\xa0news agency reported:\\xa0“Russia keeps bombing despite Syria truce; Assad vows to fight on.” Secretary Kerry expressed irritation when he\\xa0said: “If the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made... then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this. There will be an increase of activity to put greater pressure on them.” BREAKING UPDATE: Damascus confirms its army targeted by Turkey shelling https://t.co/ELk2n32dNSpic.twitter.com/2TyXsMmsY7 Kerry even warned that\\xa0“greater pressure”\\xa0could involve foreign troops being sent into Syria, without naming from which countries, saying: “There is a possibility there will be additional ground troops.” The top American diplomat made the comments while attending the Munich Security Conference along with several world leaders, held the day after the truce deal was brokered by the ISSG. Kerry told\\xa0delegates ominously:\\xa0“We hope this week can be a week of change. This moment is a hinge point. Decisions made in the coming days, weeks and months can end the war in Syria. Or, if the wrong choices are made, they can open the door to even wider conflict.” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also addressed the Munich conference, but he warned that any ground invasion in Syria by foreign forces ran the grave risk of unleashing an all-out war. Over the weekend, it was reported\\xa0that Saudi F-16 warplanes are to begin flying out of Turkey’s NATO base at Incirlik, allegedly on combat operations against the Islamic State terror group in Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that a combined Saudi-Turkish ground force was ready to intervene in Syria, and there were reports of cross-border Turkish artillery shelling of Syrian Kurdish sites. The nub of the proposed truce is that Syria and Russia are legally entitled to eradicate ISIS, Al Nusra and related groups. Strategically, too, it can be argued that the defeat of such illegally armed insurgents is a priority task in creating conditions for an end to the five-year conflict. However,\\xa0“the related terror groups”\\xa0also include many other militants whom Western governments and Western media mendaciously refer to as\\xa0“moderate rebels.”\\xa0So, while the Syrian Arab Army and Russian fighter planes can legitimately make the case that these groups are to be targeted, Washington and its allies will deceptively allege that Moscow is attacking\\xa0“moderate rebels.” This is a risible fiction constructed by Western governments, their regional partners and the Western media. It is well documented that groups like Jaish al-Islam, Jaish al-Fateh, Ahrar al-Sham and Farouq Brigade – heavily sponsored by Saudi Arabia and Qatar – are integrated with the officially recognized Al Qaeda terrorist organizations. Even the so-called\\xa0“secular”\\xa0Free Syrian Army – much championed by Washington – is in league with ISIS and Al Nusra, as are the Turkmen brigades openly\\xa0supported\\xa0by the Turkish government. US government-owned news outlet Voice of America\\xa0described\\xa0the terror-rebel connection in the following delicate way:\\xa0“The Munich deal writes out any cessation of hostilities for not only the Islamic State but [al Qaeda] affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra or other groups deemed terrorists by the UN Security Council. Some of those groups, aside from IS, have been battlefield allies of other rebel factions around Aleppo.” ‘Turkey wants to stop Kurds liberating northern Syria from ISIS’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/V3P6EmxQoApic.twitter.com/2PCkZoMcYB Meanwhile, the Washington Post admitted\\xa0that Jabhat al-Nusra “in some instances fights alongside rebel forces supported by the United States and its allies.” The Post article added that even in the event of a truce taking hold: “The United States and its partners would continue their current level of equipping and training the opposition so as not to leave the rebels at a disadvantage if the cessation of hostilities collapses.” The cessation that Washington has assiduously tried to craft is not premised on finding a genuine end to the conflict. Rather, it is evidently a tactical pause to afford proxy forces on the ground badly needed respite from the Syrian-Russian onslaught. That onslaught is threatening to wipe out the myriad terror- and terrorist-related brigades. That’s why John Kerry has been so concerned to stymie Russia’s intervention. That intervention ordered by President Vladimir Putin less than five months ago is wiping out terror assets that Washington and its allies have invested in for regime change in Syria over five years. That investment is going up in smoke, and that is also why Washington and its regional partners Turkey and Saudi Arabia are reserving a direct military contingency – in order to salvage their regime-change project. The proposed cessation in Syria is a long shot that will miss the mark of bringing peace to the war-devastated country. Because Washington and its allies are not interested in peace. They want regime change – by hook or by crook. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. '],\n",

The ruling alleged that Gazprom had abused its monopoly position in the natural gas market in 2009-2015. “In our view, it is an absolutely illegal decision, as it was not implemented by the Stockholm court,” Novak countered. The International Court of Arbitration in Stockholm is tasked with settling problems involving international business deals.According to Novak, the Kiev court ruling poses “new risks for gas transit to European customers since Ukraine can adopt the [decree on] imposition of penalties corresponding to the fine.” The energy minister said that he was surprised\\xa0by Kiev’s claims, since Gazprom has no business on Ukrainian territory, with Russian gas being handled there by the country’s Naftogaz. Warning of the possible risk to Europe due to Ukraine’s decision, Novak issued letters to the deputy head of EU Commission on energy and respective European customers. Supplies of Russian gas to Ukraine, as well as its transit to Europe for the winter period were discussed Friday in Brussels. According to Novak, Ukraine signaled its readiness to purchase up to 4 billion cubic meters of gas from Moscow, with no “controversy” on the price tag. \"Ukraine has expressed readiness to buy between 1.5 and 4 billion cubic meters of gas for winter to ensure a reliable supply to Ukrainian consumers and for transit to European consumers,” the Minister said. He added that according to two contracts (valid until 2019 and 2020 respectively) Russia “is ready to provide reliable deliveries” to all of the sides. Yet no deal or other documents have been signed as of yet, participants of the meeting in Brussels announced. Kiev is staunchly linking the signature of the respective deal to certain amendments which it proposed for the agreement. According to the Ukrainian side, it would eliminate certain risks for Kiev. “Today we did not manage to sign an additional agreement. According to the contract between Naftogaz and Gazprom, purchases of gas by Gazprom are impossible without it,” Naftogaz chief, Andrey Kobelev, told reporters. Yet both sides have agreed to continue talks to settle the issue. Russia and Ukraine have been involved in numerous gas conflicts over the past years, raising concerns in Europe as well. One of the major stumbling blocks were accusations from Gazprom that Kiev illegally obtained Russian gas from transit pipelines meant for European states. '],\n",

When the bus is stopped in traffic, the man gets up near the front edge of the bus, laughing and waving to people on the footpath below.

The South African athlete appeared in court today for sentencing after serving a year of his initial five-year sentence for manslaughter, which was changed to murder after an appeal in December 2015. The moment #OscarPistorius hears his 6-year murder sentence - and the court\\'s reactionhttps://t.co/o5GqkpHpe7https://t.co/KQ68JaQAi0 The Paralympian, 29, has caused tension in South Africa over his sentencing, with many on social media saying that Judge Thokozile Masipa was too “sympathetic” and “empathetic” towards Pistorius. The sentence is less than the prescribed minimum for murder in South Africa and the new ruling has sparked outrage and dismay in the country, with both ordinary citizens and legal experts saying that the sentence was too light. The judge, however, justified her sentencing due to Pistorius\\' rehabilitation and apparent remorse, and said: \"A long term in prison will not serve justice. \"Public opinion may be loud and persistent but it can play no role in the decision of this court.\" The prosecutors have not ruled out an appeal and have 14 days to decide if they wish to do so. Pistorius\\' legal team has said it will not appeal the verdict unless the prosecution attempts to appeal the sentence. Pistorius was taken straight to jail after the hearing, hugging his sister when the verdict was announced. He will be taken to Khosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria, where he will serve half of his sentence before he is considered for parole. Pistorius had admitted to shooting Steenkamp four times through a bathroom door in their home in 2013. He said he mistook her for an intruder. Barry and June Steenkamp, the deceased\\'s parents, sat on the opposite side of the courtroom to Pistorius. Later, Mr Steenkamp told the BBC that he was glad that the trial was over, though life would never be the same again. The gold medalist\\'s conviction has left some rights groups claiming that his reduced sentence is due to his status and wealth. Pistorius rose to stardom in 2012 when he became the first amputee to compete in the Olympic Games, running on prosthetic blades in London. '],\n",

The type of the rocket was not immediately known, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) alleged it to have been a medium range Rodong missile. “The missile hit waters within the Japanese Air Defense Identification Zone,” the JCS said.

US officials confirmed that a missile launched from North Korean territory had been detected and tracked, according to Reuters.

              "  \"“If yesterday people simply did not know what it means to be in the crosshairs in those areas of Romania, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security. And it will be the same with Poland,” Putin said during a joint press conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens on Friday. The Russian President was referring to the Deveselu facility that officially became operational in May after nearly a decade and $800 million of planning and construction. “At the moment the interceptor missiles installed have a range of 500 kilometers, soon this will go up to 1000 kilometers, and worse than that, they can be rearmed with 2400km-range offensive missiles even today, and it can be done by simply switching the software, so that even the Romanians themselves won’t know,” said Putin, who is in Greece for a two-day tour. “We have the capability to respond. The whole world saw what our medium-range sea-based missiles are capable of [in Syria]. But we violate no agreements. And our ground-based Iskander missiles have also proven themselves as superb,” continued Putin. Russia’s political and military leadership has repeatedly spoken out against the missile defense shield since it was proposed during the George W. Bush administration, and Putin reiterated that Moscow does not believe the European part of it is targeted against a potential threat from Iran. “NATO fend us off with vague statements that this is no threat to Russia… That the whole project began as a preventive measure against Iran’s nuclear program. Where is that program now? It doesn’t exist,” said Putin, referring to the nuclear treaty that was concluded between the world’s major powers and Tehran last year. “We have been saying since the early 2000s that we will have to react somehow to your moves to undermine international security. No one is listening to us.” Alexis Tsipras in his turn reiterated that Russia is a player in the European security theater and that current attempts to alienate Moscow with measures such as sanctions reminds him of Cold War times. “European security cannot be achieved without cooperation and dialogue with Russia,” Tsipras said in an interview with Sputnik. “I don't believe that we can move forward or ensure compliance with international law while caught in a vicious circle of sanctions, militarization and Cold War rhetoric.” President Putin arrived in Greece on Friday for a two-day visit that involves meetings with his Greek counterpart, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and other top-level discussions. It is the Russian president’s first EU trip in seven months, and comes just weeks before Brussels decides on whether to extend EU sanctions against Russia. Bilateral trade and investment, as well as joint energy and transport projects, were said to be major issues on the agenda for the visit. Another pressing matter for both Athens and Moscow, the economic sanctions against Russia, will also be on the table. Prime Minister Tsipras has already told RIA Novosti that the restrictions have had a negative impact on Russian-Greek economic ties, but added there are areas not covered by the sanctions where business between the two countries could perform well. The Greek PM laid a foundation of trust with the Russian leader and even proposed a visa-free travel regime in the EU for Russian nationals. “We overcame all the difficulties that arose due to changes in the issuance of Schengen visas, strengthened the work of our consulates in Russia by attracting dozens of new employees, and we are ready to meet the high demand of Russian nationals for travel to Greece. At the same time, I find it necessary, as I have already mentioned at a European level, that dialogue is relaunched on easing the visa regime for Russian citizens,” Tsipras said. Promoting international security and tackling illegal migration, which is the hot issue in Greece, are also points of mutual interest. On Saturday, President Putin will attend a prayer service at Mount Athos, which is home to 20 monasteries and is an important spiritual site for Orthodox Christians. Joined by Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, the president is expected to take part in millennial celebrations of the Russian monastic presence on Athos.     \"],\n",

MI6 has been embroiled in scandals in recent years, including allegations that the agency rendered Libyan dissenters to Tripoli, where they were tortured by the Gaddafi regime.

              "  'Private investigators hired by the Clinton campaign discovered that the network had been hacked into, CNN reported. While the campaign confirmed that their data program was accessed in the broader attacks on Democratic organizations, they claim that there is no evidence so far to indicate that their internal systems were compromised. “An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack. Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,”\\xa0campaign spokesman Nick Merrill told\\xa0CNN. The FBI made the Clinton campaign aware that it was being targeted by hackers back in March, Yahoo News reported, citing “two sources who have been briefed on the matter.” The FBI reportedly visited Clinton’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, where agents told senior officials that the campaign had been subject to so-called spear-phishing email attack attempts, without specifying who was suspected of being responsible. Yahoo News reported that the FBI had asked the Clinton campaign to hand over internal computer logs and the personal email addresses of senior campaign officials, but the request was denied by the campaign’s lawyers, citing sensitivity and concerns that the FBI’s request was too vague. This news comes after WikiLeaks released thousands of emails from Democratic Party officials three days before the Democratic National Convention began. The matter is being investigated by the US Department of Justice, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

              "  'Matthew Bacon, a British Army major, was killed by a roadside bomb while traveling in a lightly-armored Snatch vehicle in Iraq in 2005. His bereaved father described to RT his awe at the staggering success of the Iraq War Families Campaign’s crowdfunding drive to fund a full legal examination of the Chilcot Report for evidence challenging the legality of the war. The online fundraiser hit its first target of £50,000 (US$66,000) within a day of launching on Tuesday, and it is now rapidly approaching its secondary target of £150,000. Roger said the funds are needed to hire a “firm of lawyers to look at the Iraq report, to see just what kind of illegalities or misuse of constitutional powers have taken place.” He recognized Sir John Chilcot’s long-delayed report, published on July 6, is “not a legal document, and that the legality of going to war would have to be decided in a properly constituted and recognized court.” Bacon said the families of the 179 troops killed in the war are “really relieved about the report itself. It says all we thought it should say, but we do actually need to find out the legality of it because that is the only way of making sure if there has been anything that transgresses the law.” “It is the only way of making sure that what happened in Iraq never happens again,” he added. “Matthew was a soldier’s soldier, he loved the soldiering life, and by the time he went to Iraq he was a major in the Intelligence Corps,” Bacon said of his late 34-year-old son. The consensus among the families, for whom Roger has been a regular spokesman, is “we did not think we should have gone into Iraq in the first place, we are also concerned, of course, about some of the equipment failures, which had resulted partially because of the lack of planning at the beginning.” Much of the controversy around Iraq, he said, “goes back to some of the decisions made by Tony Blair in taking us up to the war.” He pointed out that with the International Criminal Court (ICC) not yet able to rule on war crimes, criminal charges unlikely, and no indication from the government or parliament that “punitive action” will be taken, “the only recourse we have left is to take civil proceedings in this country.” The result of civil action, Bacon acknowledged, would be compensation, which he said the families were not “particularly interested” in. “But the advantage of that is that we can then use it to somehow give back to the Iraqi people, to do something to improve their lives,” he said.

Twenty-seven of the signatories were briefly detained. \"Academics who express their opinions have been detained one by one on instructions given by a so-called dictator,\" he said during a speech to his party\\'s 35th General Congress in Ankara, referring to those who have signed petitions opposing the military crackdown on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK) and urging an end to curfews. \"You may not agree with the content of the declaration.

A petition presented to the public prosecutor’s office also asked for a civil lawsuit to be launched against the CHP, Turkey’s Anadolu agency reported. The biggest opposition party in Turkey, with 134 seats in the 550-member Turkish parliament, the CHP, has been led by Kilicdaroglu since May 2010. In addition to the lawsuit, an attorney from the Ankara prosecutor\\'s office has also launched an investigation into Kilicdaroglu\\'s comments on charges of “openly insulting the president,” local media reported. In Turkey, insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in jail. Although Kilicdaroglu has immunity from prosecution because he is a lawmaker, parliament could vote by a simple majority to remove that protection. It\\'s not the first time that Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu have clashed. In June 2015, Erdogan filed a 100,000 lira ($32,000) lawsuit against the CHP leader for “mental anguish” following a public spat over claims that there were golden toilet seats installed in the presidential palace.

The agency said it was seeking further details of the launch. The US State Department has harshly condemned North Korea’s plans, saying that any satellite launch by North Korea would be an “egregious violation” of its international obligations. US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel told reporters that the North Korean plans “argue even more strongly” for tougher UN sanctions. At the end of January, US officials said North Korea was preparing for some kind of a space launch citing satellite imagery. The news of a looming satellite launch comes just weeks after North Korea claimed that it successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb which sparked international outrage and calls for new stricter sanctions against the country. North Korea carried out its last rocket launch in 2012 saying that the rocket carried a Kwangmyongsong-3 weather satellite. The country was however accused by the US, South Korea and Japan of testing a long-range ballistic missile. The DPRK started its nuclear program in late 1980s – early 1990s, but announced that it possessed nuclear weapons only in 2005. Since then North Korea carried out four nuclear tests – in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016.

But now that loophole is closing. \"Starting next week, in addition to our existing practice, we will also use geolocation signals (IP addresses etc) to restrict access to the delisted URL on all Google Search domains, including google.com, when accessed from the country of the person requesting the removal,\" the company said\\xa0in a blog. The tech giant says the decision to enact change to search results comes after “specific discussions” with EU data protection regulators that have been ongoing in recent months. “We believe that this additional layer of delisting enables us to provide the enhanced protections that European regulators ask us for, while also upholding the rights of people in other countries to access lawfully published information,” the company said. The “right to be forgotten” policy was established in 2014 by the Court of Justice of the European Union to protect the internet freedom of individuals online. The court judgment ruled that internet search engines are responsible for the “processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties.” It gives Europeans the right to ask the search engines to delist links about them that are inaccurate or outdated. To implement the ruling, an individual must submit the URL they want to delist through Google\\'s webform.

              "  'In an attempt to offer voters a different perspective on the United States than her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, who is pushing an \"America First\" platform, Clinton this week promoted the idea of the United States as the \"exceptional\" nation in the world. “If there’s one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of the way, it is this: The United States is an exceptional nation,” Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, told a meeting of the American Legion’s national convention. RT spoke with author and historian Gerald Horne for his opinion on these sentiments and what they mean for global politics. RT: In her latest interview to NYT, Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of the US going as far as to call the country \"exceptional\" and \"indispensable\". What are your thoughts on that? Gerald Horne: Well, I would suggest that Secretary Clinton take lessons from President Barack Obama, who was asked if he believed that the United States was an exceptional country. He said yes, but he also said he\\'s sure that the British leadership feels that Britain is an exceptional country, that the Greek leadership feels that Greece is an exceptional country and on down the line. I think that Secretary Clinton must realize that, and so when she goes down that road, about so-called American exceptionalism, what she\\'s really trying to do is provide a rationale and an argument for US hegemony and US domination of the world. RT: During one of her rallies this year the Democratic candidate explicitly accused Vladimir Putin of raising the popularity of ‘extreme nationalism’. Do you think her stance on the Russian leader goes at odds with her recent statement? GH: She gives away the game when she talks about the so-called alliances, the military alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which lost its reason for being when the Soviet Union collapsed, but continues plotting along nonetheless and is moving ever closer to the borders of Russia, which is a direct provocation. When she talks about US exceptionalism, I would also urge her to go to her history books and study about the dispossession of the Native Americans and the enslavement of the Africans, which formed the foundation of this country. If she ingested and digested those lessons, I think she would be much less inclined to talk about so-called US exceptionalism. ‘American exceptionalism is a Rorschach test meaning anything you want it to be’ (Op-Edge by @LionelMedia) https://t.co/moJ0qspqaf RT: The idea of exceptionalism is something Hillary Clinton also dismisses as a part of the US patriotism, yet many deem it to be a flimsy comparison. What\\'s your take on that? GH: Well, it\\'s very odd for Secretary Clinton to be talking about extreme nationalism. If you read those words that forms the basis for our conversation, you could easily conclude that the word chauvinism, which is actually a French derivation, might be of US derivation. That is to say, her words reeked with US national chauvinism, so it\\'s rather odd that she would accuse another leader of what she is actually guilty of. RT: Boosting patriotism through imposing the ideas of being superior to other nations seemed like a worrying trend to quite a few people on social media, with some of the users even bringing up the policies of Adolf Hitler as an example. How fair is this comparison, in your opinion? GH: Well, to repeat the United States is an exceptional nation. It\\'s exceptional in its level of violence, particularly in terms of the founding of this so-called republic. It\\'s exceptional in its level of racism, particularly towards black people as reflected in police killings that have pot marked the landscape on a regular basis for months if not years now, so yes, she is correct when she talks about US exceptionalism. The problem is that she\\'s looking through the wrong end of the telescope. 3 rules of US Exceptionalism: 1) Our killing is better than theirs; 2) Nothing we do can be \"terrorism\"; 3) Only enemies are \"war criminals\" RT: The US exceptionalism can be also seen through the role of the \"international police\" the country has long assumed. GH: Let\\'s put it this way. Like many people in North America right now, I\\'m very much concerned about the prospect of war right now. When Secretary Clinton talks about establishing a no-fly zone in Syria, she is basically saying that if she\\'s sworn in to the highest office in the land, in January 2017, she will be challenging Russian jets over Syria. This is a direct provocation. It could easily devolve into World War III. I\\'m very much concerned about the hawkish language coming out of Washington that in a very cavalier fashion is talking about confronting and challenging Moscow, a major nuclear power. This is insanity. This is lunacy. This is extremely dangerous. The United States styles itself as the police officer of planet Earth. The problem is no one has appointed the United States to be the police officer of planet Earth. I would advise Secretary Clinton as I would advise others in Washington that they should take their demands and their claims to the United Nations Security Council and United Nations New York and hash them out there, and come to a compromise, rather than unilaterally seeking to impose their diktat all over the world, most recently in Syria.

              "  'In comments made Wednesday the president of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), Ronald Lauder, slammed the remarks made by the Polish Education Minister Anna Zalewska and the mayor of the town of Jedwabne, Michael Chajewski. Speaking to private broadcaster TVN24 last week, Zalewska refused to openly admit the involvement of Polish citizens in the massacres of Jews in the town of Jedwabne in 1941, in which more than 300 Jews were burned alive inside a barn, and in Kielce in 1946, in which 42 Jews were shot by Polish police. \"Jedwabne is a historical fact that has led to many misunderstandings and very biased opinions,\" Zalewska said on July 13, adding that “the dramatic situation which took place in Jedwabne is controversial. Many historians, distinguished professors, paint a completely different picture,” as quoted by Reuters. On Kielce, she said the perpetrators were anti-Semites, \"but not quite Polish.\" Following Zalewska’s remarks, Jedwabne mayor Chajewski issued a statement calling for an exhumation of mass graves in Jedwabne “to see if the victims had been killed by German soldiers.” In a statement\\xa0issued on Wednesday, Lauder called Zalewska’s remarks and Chajewski’s subsequent calls to exhume the remains of the Jedwabne massacre victims “disturbing” and a “slap in the face” of Holocaust survivors. He also insisted that the two officials immediately issued clearly-worded apologies and retracted their remarks. He also advised the two politicians to follow the suit of the Polish President Andrzej Duda, who earlier strongly condemned anti-Semitism at multiple state observances that marked massacres in Jedwabne and Kielce. “Minister Zalewska and Mayor Chajewski would do well to heed the words of President Andrzej Duda who said earlier this month at the 70th anniversary of the Kielce pogrom that ‘In a free, sovereign and independent Poland there is no room for any form of prejudice. There is no room for racism, for xenophobia, for anti-Semitism’,” Lauder said. \"It is disturbing to think that senior government officials in Poland, a country that ... has done so much to advance the cause of Holocaust education and scholarship, now seem to be lurching backward to the days of obfuscation and misinformation,\" he added. He also stressed that the two politicians undermined the efforts of Polish scholars,\\xa0“who have spent more than 25 years unearthing evidence of horrifying acts of violence against Jews committed by Poles.” Earlier, Zalewska’s remarks also provoked a wave of indignation from various activist groups and Jewish communities. Rafal Pankowski, the head of Never Again, a Polish anti-racism organization, told AP on July 14 that his group was \"appalled by those comments which amount to denial of the historical truth about anti-Semitic pogroms.\" Poland’s Jewish community “is stunned and hurt by the words of the Minister of Education,” Polish chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said following the minister’s remarks. Polish society has long avoided discussions about the killings of Jews, committed by Polish people during and after World War II. A turning point was the 2001 publication of the book “Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland” by a Polish-American sociologist, Jan Tomasz Gross, who said that about 1,600 Jews were killed in the town. The publication was followed by an investigation by Poland\\'s state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), which concluded that Gross\\'s estimate of 1,600 victims \"seems highly unlikely” and put the death toll at about 340 people. At the same time, it confirmed that local inhabitants were involved in the Jedwabne massacre. The massacres of Jews committed by the Poles are also a controversial issue for the ruling Law and Justice Party that promised to make Poland proud of its history and achievements. The WJC’s demand for an apology comes just a day after Polish parliament approved the assignment of Jaroslaw Szarek to the post of the head of the IPN, which investigated the killings in Jedwabne. Szarek earlier said that the Jedwabne massacre was a crime committed by the Nazi occupiers, who \"forcibly used a group of Poles in (their) machine of terror,” as he spoke to a parliamentary committee, Polish PAP news agency reports.

It also promised to hold a possible referendum on joining the European Union. Taking advantage of public anger following the Panama Papers scandal in April and acting on fears of perceived political corruption in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, the Pirate Party offered full governmental transparency, individual freedoms and the fight against corruption. The Pirates seek to decriminalize drugs and introduce a policy of offering asylum to whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.

A live video from the Bundy Ranch’s Facebook showed some supporters claiming that Ammon Bundy’s attorney Marcus Mumford was tased in court by federal marshals. KATU reported that Mumford was in US Marshal custody after being allegedly tackled for yelling that Bundy was free to go following the announcement of the verdict. The Bundy brothers have yet to be released due to a federal hold over their standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada. Mumford’s insistence that they were to be released in Oregon is what led to the fight between him and federal marshals, according to KATU.

              "  'Speaking about genetics, Zaporozhye and the Donbass [region]... they are imported cities. There is no genetics there, Evgeny Nishchuk said on Monday in an interview with local local TV channel ICTV when asked why Ukrainian culture is spreading so slowly. The comment was quickly noticed both inside and outside Ukraine. The Opposition Bloc party forwarded a plea to the Ukrainian parliament to make Nishchuk give up his office, saying that “societies based on ethnical segregation have long been outdated” and “he would be punished for this kind of comments in a civilized society.” “The minister points to ethnically unclean people who are, however, still providing for Ukraine’s economics and national budget,” the party’s statement said. The leader of Ukraine’s Radical Party, Oleg Lyashko, harshly condemned Nishchuk on his Facebook page and didn’t hesitate to call him “an idiot,” who should be fired as a “genetically impaired” person. Ukraine’s energy minister, Igor Nasalik, was less emotional, but still disapproving. “He was talking history, that I understand … but I don’t share his viewpoint,” Nasalik said, according to local news outlet Strana. Nishchuk apologized at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, explaining that he “didn’t want to offend anybody” and he was talking about “the importance of culture dialogue and exchange”. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, made statements about rebels living in the Donbass region, which has been in an armed conflict with the Ukrainian government ever since it came to power in the 2014 Kiev coup. “I doubt that any of our western partners would take these words as an offense,” Maria Zakharova wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday. “Most probably they won’t see them at all. They pay so much attention to human rights. And they pay so little when it comes to politically troublesome regions,” Zakharova noted. It\\'s no surprise it\\'s so hard to stick to the Minsk roadmap to peace in Ukraine, given that “Ukraininan governments see Donbass residents as culturally different people whose identity should be corrected,” Zakharova wrote. Earlier this month the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forced said that people in Donbass harbor extreme hatred for Ukraine’s security officials, adding that they passed information about their locations over to rebel fighters. In August, Viktoria Syumar, deputy secretary of Ukraine\\'s Security Council, suggested holding a nationwide referendum on whether it was worth fighting for control over Donbass, saying it that would take too much in terms of resources to restore the infrastructure there and besides, and that the local population \"hates Ukraine.\" Before that, in June, Vadim Chernysh, Minister for Temporarily Occupied Territories (the official description of the Donbass area, which Kiev says was invaded by Russia), said that even if Donbass is brought back under Ukraine\\'s control, its residents still won’t acknowledge the official Ukrainian government. Since August, 2016, the conflict has claimed the lives of over 9,500 people over two years of warfare, according to UN data. '],\n",

Goddard is the third chair to step down, after lawyer Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss both quit in 2014. The appointment of Goddard by then-Home Secretary Theresa May was considered unorthodox at the time, given that her expertise lies in a foreign legal system. Her resignation is a blow for May in her first weeks as PM.

In a resignation letter to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Goddard said she was “confident” there had been “some very real gains for victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.” “The conduct of any public inquiry is not an easy task, let alone one of the magnitude of this. Compounding the many difficulties was its legacy of failure which has been very hard to shake off and with hindsight it would have been better to have started completely afresh,” she added.

She was the wrong choice from the beginning. She came from a judicial system in a country which is 20 years behind the UK.” Home Affairs Committee chair Keith Vaz MP said he shocked by the sudden resignation. “We will expect a full explanation from both the prime minister and the new home secretary.” '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The great Paul McCartney famously bellowed: \"Michelle, Ma Belle, these are words that go together well.\" While they don\\'t rhyme as nicely, the words EU and hypocrisy also combine perfectly. An organization ostensibly dedicated to the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and human rights is ignoring rampant abuses in Turkey. Worse still, by its warm embrace of Recip Tayyip Erdogan, it\\'s encouraging his behavior. Meanwhile, the obsequious western media is largely silent. In the seminal 1978 movie,\\xa0Midnight Express, a naive westerner gets trapped inside the Turkish legal system. Initially, he cooperates with the authorities, offering assistance in the hope of a fair deal. However, they renege and he hurtles into a downward spiral of abuse and resignation. Only when he faces annihilation, does he manage to escape. Even bribes don’t translate to guarantees, and he ultimately has to fight his way out. Brussels\\' current relationship with Turkey is not unlike the plot of Midnight Express. It’s based on entrapment, coercion and blackmail. With its fragile unity creaking, the very survival of the EU is in jeopardy. Hence, Ankara holds all the aces and its increasingly dictatorial president is using his hand to extort concession after concession. By acquiescing, the EU is diluting its once cherished ‘values.\\' In the long term, it may be signing its own death warrant. By making dirty deals with Erdogan, Brussels’ emboldens ‘illiberal’ politicians on Europe’s fringes to resist its authority. Hungary and Poland’s current leaders must be rubbing their hands with glee. And make no mistake, Friday’s transaction between the EU and Turkey was a dirty deal. Ankara has\\xa0agreed that migrants arriving to the EU after Sunday can be sent back. In return, Turkey can release a properly registered migrant from its own territory to the EU. The number is capped at 72,000. A figure that seems to have been pulled from the ether. While the arrangement sounds reasonably straightforward in theory, it’s difficult to envisage how it can succeed in practice. There are already over 45,000 migrants stranded in Greece alone. Despite pleas from Angela Merkel for all EU members to\\xa0accept their ‘fair share’ of people, only 937 have found a new home so far. Thus, the ultimate result of Friday’s accord will most likely be that another 72,000 souls are thrown into a Greek purgatory. This scenario will - hypothetically at least - prevent them moving north to Germany, Sweden and Austria, for example. Naturally, that’s the whole point of this murky understanding. In return, Brussels has agreed to speed up the disbursement of €3 billion to Ankara. It has also offered ‘re-energized’ talks on EU membership. Germany wanted to give more concessions in that regard. But Cyprus, with a considerable amount of its territory occupied by Turkey (and the UK), objected. In reality, Erdogan has no desire to join the EU. If Ankara did become a full member, it would presumably have to revert to genuine democracy. Doing so would loosen Erdogan’s totalitarian grip on power. Instead, what Erdogan really wants is for Western Europe’s elite to legitimize his regime. His strategy is working. The same politicians who endlessly rant and rave about \\'values\\' are now bowing to a thug who has reversed the long celebrated reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Make no mistake, Turkey, long an oasis of modernity in a troubled Middle East, is going backwards at an alarming rate. Erdogan reportedly\\xa0said on Wednesday, in Ankara, “democracy, freedom and the rule of law… for us, these words have absolutely no value any longer.” Just imagine if a leader less valuable to current western strategy made such a statement? For example, Vladimir Putin or Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff? There’d be venom spat all over the op-ed pages from The New York Times to Le Monde and Die Welt. But when a NATO member’s president spouts such things, the same newspapers don\\'t even report the comments. Erdogan didn’t stop there. He also said Turkey will “strike Kurds everywhere.” These are the same Kurds that America (and Russia, too) has partnered with in the war against ISIS. Yet, the US government seems oblivious to Erdogan\\'s words. ‘Turkey leveraging refugees to get what it wants’ (Op-Edge) https://t.co/4o7LV0shvFpic.twitter.com/T6UfIx3ybA According to the CPJ (Committee to Protect Journalists), in 2013, Turkey had\\xa0jailed more members of the media than China (40 against 32). For the record, Russia was held responsible for two cases and the USA one. The only EU state included was Italy, also with one. Now, you’d imagine that freedom of the press is a core “European value,” but even their colleagues in the western media don’t make noise about the oppression of Turkish journalists. Across government and the establishment press, there seems to be an understanding that you cannot criticize Turkey. That’s because everybody is afraid to upset Erdogan. If this bully doesn’t get what he wants, he can flood Europe with migrants. And Jihadis. Not only that, if Turkey withdrew from NATO, the US would lose vital military bases it needs to dominate the Middle East. Erdogan has them all over a barrel. And he knows it. He must enjoy watching them squirm. Aside from these issues, it’s very doubtful that Friday’s arrangement will prove effective anyway. The Turkey-EU transaction gave Greece 48 hours to build a functioning asylum system and a court to hear challenges against returns. Considering that Strasbourg\\xa0says (MSS v Belgium and Greece) that Greece has not had a functioning asylum system for ten years, this seems a trifle optimistic. Not to mention that one particular legal issue could derail the whole project. EU member states have not been able to send asylum seekers back to Greece, since a 2011 court ruling which\\xa0found that migrants suffered “degrading treatment” and faced inadequate processes that meant they were at risk of being sent back to countries where they faced persecution. Ultimately, even if Greece somehow manages to control of the situation, and Erdogan keeps his word, where will these migrants eventually go? To the UK perhaps? It has already\\xa0given $1.7 billion to refuges in Syria. But London won’t take them in. Meanwhile, the only two countries who were willing to take masses of migrants last year, Germany and Sweden, have cried “enough.\" Right now, it’s impossible to predict how this gigantic mess will ever be resolved. Yet, to paraphrase an old Irish expression, “If I was trying to get there, I wouldn’t start from here.” There are many potential losers in this crisis. Brussels, Merkel and thousands of innocent migrants being the most obvious. Nevertheless, there’s one surefire winner - Erdogan. He’s got the EU wrapped around his finger. And he knows it.

Afghans must now rest assured that NATO’s Resolute Support mission – plus “financial support for Afghan forces” – will finally assure the success of Operation Enduring Freedom forever. Libyans must be reassured, in the words of NATO figurehead secretary Jens Stoltenberg, that we “should stand ready to support the new Government of National Accord in Libya.” And then there’s the icing on the NATO cake, described as\\xa0“measures against Russia”. Stoltenberg duly confirmed, “We have already decided to enhance our forward presence in the eastern part of our alliance. Our military planners have put forward proposals of several battalions in different countries in the region. No decision has been taken on the numbers and locations.” These puny “several battalions” won’t cause any Russian planner to lose sleep. The real “measure” is the\\xa0deployment of the Aegis Ashore system in Romania last week – plus a further one in Poland in 2018. This has been vehemently opposed by Moscow since the early 2000s. NATO’s argument that the Aegis represents protection against the “threat” of ballistic missiles from Iran does not even qualify as kindergarten play. Every Russian military planner knows the Aegis is not defensive. This is a serious game-changer – as in de-localizing US nuclear capability to Eastern Europe. No wonder Russian President Vladimir Putin had to make it clear Russia would respond “adequately” to any threat to its security. Predictably all Cold War 2.0 hell broke loose, all over again. A former NATO deputy commander went ballistic, while saner heads\\xa0wondered whether Moscow, sooner rather than later, would have had enough of these shenanigans and prepare for war. A case can be made that the Beltway – neocons and neoliberalcons alike - do not want a hot war with Russia. What they want, apart from racking in more cash for the Pentagon, is to raise the ante to such a high level that Moscow will back down - based on a rational cost analysis. Yet oil prices will inevitably rise later in 2016 – and under this scenario Washington is a loser. So we may see a raise of interest rates by the Fed (with all the money continuing to go to Wall Street) trying to reverse the scenario. Comparisons of the current NATO buildup to pre-WWII buildups, or to NATO when opposed to the Warsaw Pact, are amateurish. The THAAD and Patriot missiles are worthless - according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) themselves; that’s why they tried to improve them with Iron Dome. Meanwhile, those new NATO army “battalions” are inconsequential. The basic thrust behind the Pentagon’s moves under neocon Ash Carter continues to be to draw Russia ever further into Syria and Ukraine (as if Moscow actually was involved in, or wanted, a Ukrainian quagmire); trap Russia in proxy wars; and economically bleed Russia to death while crippling the bulk of oil and natural gas income to the Russian state. Russia does not want – and does not need – war. Yet the “Russian aggression” narrative never stops. Thus it’s always enlightening to come back to this RAND corporation study, which examined what would happen if a war actually took place. RAND reached an “unambiguous” conclusion after a series of war games in 2015-2015; Russia could overrun NATO in a mere 60 hours – if not less – if it ever amounted to a hot war on European soil. The Rand Corporation is essentially a CIA outpost – thus a propaganda machine. Yet it’s not propaganda to state the Baltic States and Ukraine would completely fall in less than three days before the Russian Army. However, the suggestion that additional NATO air power and heavily armored combat divisions would make a material difference is bogus. The Aegis changes the game in the sense that it qualifies as a launch area for US missile defense. Think US missiles with minimum flying time – around 30 minutes – from Moscow; that’s a certified threat to the Russian nation. The Russian military has also been “unambiguous”; if it is ascertained that NATO – via the Pentagon – is about to try something funny, there are grounds for a preventive strike by Iskander-M systems out of Transnistria – as in the destruction of the US missiles by conveniently armed precision weapons. Meanwhile, Moscow has pulled a stunning success – of course, it’s far from over – in Syria. So what’s left for the Pentagon – via NATO – is essentially to play the scare tactics card. They know Russia is prepared for war – certainly much better prepared than NATO. They know neither Putin nor the Russian military will back down because of kindergarten scaremongering. As for a too conciliatory tone by the Kremlin towards Washington, things may be about to\\xa0change soon. The Russian military are about to\\xa0test the first prototypes of the S-500 Prometey air and missile defense system, also known as 55R6M Triumfator M – capable of destroying ICBMs, hypersonic cruise missiles and planes at over Mach 5 speeds; and capable of detecting and simultaneously attacking up to ten ballistic missile warheads at a range of 1300 km. This means the S-500 can smash ballistic missiles before their warheads re-enter the atmosphere. Russian Navy ‘Zircon’ hypersonic missile ‘likely’ to go into production as early as 2018 https://t.co/PxeXQBrKp0pic.twitter.com/JsE7Y2WZns So in the case of RAND-style NATO pussyfooting, the S-500 would totally eliminate all NATO air power over the Baltic States – while the advanced Kornet missile would destroy all NATO armored vehicles. And that’s not even\\xa0considering conventional weapon hell. If push comes to nuclear shove, the S-400 and especially the S-500 anti-missile missiles would block all incoming US ICBMs, cruise missiles and stealth aircraft. Offensive drones would be blocked by drone defenses. The S-500 practically consigns to the dustbin stealth warplanes such as the F-22, F-35 and the B-2. The bottom line is that Russia – in terms of hypersonic missile development – is about four generations ahead of the US, if we measure it by the development of the S-300, S-400 and S-500 systems. As a working hypothesis, we could describe the next system – already in the drawing boards – as the S-600. It would take the US military at least ten years to develop and roll out a new weapons system, which in military terms represents a generation. Every Pentagon planner worth his pension plan should know that. Russian – and Chinese – missiles are already able to knock out the satellite guidance systems for US nuclear tipped ICBMs and cruise missiles. They could also knock out the early alert warnings that the satellite constellations would give. A Russian hypersonic ICBM flight time, launched for instance from a Russian nuclear sub all the way to the US East Coast, counts for less than 20 minutes. So an early warning system is absolutely critical. Don’t count on the worthless THAAD and Patriot to do their job. Once again, Russian hypersonic technology has already\\xa0rendered the entire missile defense system in both the US and Europe totally obsolete. So why is Moscow so worried by the Pentagon placing the Aegis system so close to Russia’s borders? A credible answer is that Moscow is always concerned that the US industrial military-complex might develop some really effective anti-missile missiles even though they are now about four generations behind. At the same time, Pentagon planners have reasons to be very worried by what they know, or hint. At the same time the Russian military – in a very Asian way – never reveal their full hand. The key fact of the matter needs to be stressed over and over again; the S-500 is impenetrable - and allows Russia for the first time in history to launch a first strike nuclear attack, if it ever chooses to do so, and be immune to retaliation. The rest is idle babbling. Still, expect the official Pentagon/NATO narrative to remain the same. After all, the industrial-military complex is a cash-devouring hydra, and a powerful enemy is a must (the phony Daesh “caliphate” does not count). The Threat Narrative rules that Russia has to meekly accept being surrounded by NATO. Russia is not allowed any response; in any case, any response will be branded as “Russian aggression”. If Russia defends itself, this will be “exposed” as an unacceptable provocation. And may even furnish the pretext for a pre-emptive attack by NATO against Russia. Now let those Pentagon/NATO planners duly go back to play in their lavish kindergarten.

              "  'The overall number of militants who have been executed remains ambiguous. AhlulBayt News Agency (ABNA) is reporting\\xa0that 35 fighters were killed, while Iraqi News is reporting that Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) buried\\xa045 of its members alive on charges of fleeing the battlefield. The executions took place on the outskirts of Qayyarah, about 35 miles (60 kilometers) south of the militant-held city of Mosul, an anonymous provincial source told ABNA. According to reports, those who were buried alive were accused of fleeing clashes with government forces in the village of Bashir, just south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Another source confirmed the slaying to IraqiNews.com, saying that “ISIS had buried its members, who escaped from al-Bashir battles, inside one grave.” According to Arabic language media, on Monday ISIS command also shot and killed dozens of its fighters in the village of al-Hadar south of Mosul – likewise for escaping from battle in Anbar province. The murder of ISIS fighters by its own command seems to show an increased morale deterioration within its ranks as desertions become widespread. The hardline group currently suffers from a shortage of manpower and financial resources due to the intensified airstrikes and ground attacks by anti-terror forces in both Iraq and Syria.

According to Gazdiev, militants and jihadists “have been trying to seemingly blow their way into the city using whatever armaments they have, the heaviest of them actually rockets, missiles, homemade bombs packed with nails. It has been relentless, blanket bombardment of the city and civilians are paying a terrible price.” As of midday local time, three people died in the militant assaults, while some 40 more were injured. An RT crew visited a hospital in the government-controlled area, which treated those injured in the devastating shelling. “I was heading back on my bicycle when a shell landed next to me,” a 12-year-old boy who was injured told RT.

Detailed Result on the Website of Ministry of Interior: pic.twitter.com/gTwMoLUXVS Now Van der Bellen, who ran as an independent but whose campaign was backed financially by his party, is to become Austria’s first Green president. Hofer has already posted an address to his supporters conceding defeat: “I thank you for your great support. Of course I'm sad today. I would like to watch out for you as president of our wonderful country. I will remain loyal to you and make my contribution for a positive future of Austria. Please do not be discouraged. The cause of this election campaign is not lost, consider it an investment into the future,” Hofer wrote on his Facebook page. VDB 50.3 - 2.254.484HOF 49.7 - 2.223.458#bpw16___Bild: Screenshot orf.at pic.twitter.com/9BQXL3ZjXC In a race that was almost too close to call, the 4.48 million direct votes counted on Sunday, before postal votes were added, gave 72-year-old Van der Bellen 48.1 per cent against 51.9 percent for his rival, the Euroskeptic, anti-immigration Hofer. The remaining 885,000 mail-in ballots – more than 10 percent of the 6.4 million Austrians eligible to vote – took some 20 hours to count, and overturned Sunday’s results. Before the election began, Van der Bellen was considered a firm favorite. It was Hofer who unexpectedly won the first round, though, claiming 35 percent of votes compared to 21.3 percent for Van der Bellen.\\xa0 However, Hofer’s failure to secure a majority of votes paved the way for the runoff. A number of Austrian political analysts and pollsters, including the SORA policy research institute, recently predicted the mail-in ballots were likely to favor Van der Bellen, as the majority of these votes are cast by expatriates who tend to prefer open-border and pro-EU policies. Furthermore, as an economics professor and former head of the increasingly popular eco-friendly Green Party, Van der Bellen has strong support in cities. During his election campaign, Van der Bellen spoke of his hopes for a closing of ranks between supporters of all major parties in order to prevent the Freedom Party (FPO) from winning the election, describing himself as a “lesser evil.” Van der Bellen’s campaign was not as controversial as Hofer’s, who had even carried a gun to election rallies, calling it a “natural consequence” of immigration. Hofer and the FPO’s nationalist appeal to put “Austria first,” paired by strong opposition to “forced multiculturalism, globalization and mass immigration” secured the candidate increasing support because of deepening frustration with the ruling parties and how they are dealing with the migrant crisis that has engulfed Europe. “I'm not a dangerous person, of course. But those people […] who don't appreciate our country, who go to war for the Islamic State [IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL] or rape women – I say to those people: ‘This is not your home! You can't stay in Austria!’ Because we differentiate very clearly between those who continue to build up Austria together with us and those who only care about destroying this country. We have to make this differentiation,” Hofer said in a recent election rally. The prospect of Hofer’s victory shocked European political establishments long before the runoffs. Senior European officials like Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, issued warnings that “Europe’s character will be changed” if the FPO wins the post. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called on Austrian people to vote for any alternative to Hofer. Still, this is the first time in Austrian history that no candidate from the traditionally powerful centrist coalition parties (Social Democratic SPO and Conservative OVP) was represented in the runoffs. SPO member and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann had resigned earlier in May, partly because of his party’ debacle in the first round of presidential elections. Political analyst Gerhard Mangott told RT the huge success of the Freedom Party and the fact that none of the ruling parties even got into the runoffs shows that Austrians are deeply dissatisfied with the way the authorities are dealing with existing problems – with mass immigration just one of these.“It was […] a vote against the establishment. People are fed up with the current government that is not able to deal with the economic crisis in the country. It was a socially-motivated protest against the government,” Mangott said. He also noted that despite losing the presidential election, Hofer and his party’s current success is a clear sign the right-wingers will not take no for an answer and will target the position of chancellor next. “[…] despite the fact that they’ve lost today they will use all the support they’ve received now for the forthcoming parliamentary election.” \"],\n",

Sunday’s twin explosions in eastern Baghdad killed at least 73 people and left about 110 more wounded. The first bomb detonated at an outdoor market in Sadr City, which is a mainly Shia district.

We’re seeing a string of attacks in Iraq, in Syria, and we need to recognize that the concept which is a fallacy: in some parts of the Western world they say ISIS is predominantly a Muslim group against the West, and a conflict between Islam and the West – it is a fallacy. The reality is that ISIS is killing more Muslims and more people of the region than westerners. This is a sort of abomination against the whole of humanity…what could be done?

But the reality is that we know that there is no way to stop all terrorist attacks; you could stop a majority of them. Unfortunately, as long as they are able to sell oil, as long as they are able to get resources, finances and support, which is pouring through Turkey and elsewhere, they are going to continue.

The reality is that for those who are operating in the region it is very difficult to separate who is ISIS, who is Jabhat Al-Nusra, and who is the other opposition - they are working together. Any ceasefire is going to give them some level of benefit. But I think the reality is that in Syria we need to separate all these different interests and concentrate on the terrorist groups; recognize that Western sort of policies in Iraq and Syria actually created ISIS.

Second place was claimed by Delft University of Technology of the Netherlands, third went to the University of Wisconsin, while Virginia Tech and the University of California, Irvine came in fourth and fifth respectively. “What we really intended to do with the Hyperloop competition is spur interest in new forms of transportation. And I’m starting to think this is really going to happen,” said Musk to the crowd after the results were announced. We were excited to welcome Elon Musk to Aggieland today as part of this weekend's SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Design... The first five teams will get a chance to test their capsule prototypes at a Hyperloop Test Track being built next to SpaceX’s headquarters in California. “We’re going to test (the pods) at the highest possible speed on the 1.5 kilometer track, and of course you have to stop before the end. There will be a foam pit at the end so you might recover some pieces of your pod,” Musk also said. The so-called Hyperloop is a project to create a high-speed transportation system involving pressurized capsules riding on air cushions inside a tube, which would be capable of carrying 20 to 30 people at a speed of about 700 mph (1,127 km/h). The initial design documents published in 2013 proposed a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco that could be traversed in less than 35 minutes.

Lawmakers at the European Parliament voted 369-255 in favor of the resolution, proposals for which will be addressed at a European Council meeting in December. The resolution envisions dedicating two percent of member nations’ GDP to defence as well as establishing EU multinational forces, to allow the bloc to act in any situation in which NATO could be unwilling to. MEPs called on member states to pursue joint purchases of “defence resources,” and to share non-lethal material such as transport vehicles or aircraft. The resolution asked the European Council to lead the creation of “common Union defence policy and to provide additional financial resources ensuring its implementation.” The legislatures also backed investment in defence-related research projects “of at least €90 million ($96mn) during next three years”, which could be followed up by a separate European Defence Research Programme with an annual budget of €500 million ($530mn). Under the approved resolution, Britain could be forced to help fund the project because Article 50 – the clause which must be invoked to trigger an exit from the union – will not have been enacted by the time the project is ratified. Many in Europe believe such a force is required to bolster the union after the British exit. “At a time when public support for the EU is being called into question in some member states, defense and security is an area where the individual and collective benefits of more Europe can be easily demonstrated, especially regarding the likely challenges to EU’s standing as a strategic actor following Brexit,” the EU has said. The initiative would also see the creation of a European defense minister, who would oversee the army’s foundation, and an almost immediate injection of £76 million (US$95 million) for “preparatory action on EU defense research.” If the UK proves incapable of untangling itself from the plan it could be required to shell out up to £420 million per year. MEPs who are both for and against the idea spoke out on Monday ahead of the main debate. Liberal MEP Urmas Paet was reported in the Express newspaper as saying “the state of European security has grown increasingly fragile. The EU, in order to defend itself and increase security, must do more.” UKIP MEP, Brexiteer and former soldier Mike Hookem, meanwhile, said the army could drag the UK into a war against its will. “It could threaten Britain’s military readiness if it were to be dragged along in an EU military by a political establishment trying it’s hardest to ignore the result of the EU referendum and leave the EU,” he warned. He appeared to argue that EU laws which govern some EU militaries would have a diminishing effect on UK forces. “There are clear security reasons why members of the armed forces are subject to different rules from those in civilian life: rules which were compensated for previously by governments who took the welfare of its troops and this country seriously with work and fiscal benefits,” he said. “It is not in the country’s national interests for soldiers, sailors or airmen to be able to lay down arms and ignore the chain of command because of a union decision. “I have been on exercises with Danish troops who stopped working at 1700hrs. Military life does not work like that and war does not fit into a 9-5 schedule,” he warned. Political writer and journalist Dan Glazebrook believes that the resolution is “not really a surprise.” “Since the economic crisis, a crisis ... [in] the US, and [the] Germany crisis since 1970 on[wards], it has always been a matter of time actually,” Glazebrook told RT. “The whole world is deep in global capitalist crisis. The US is unable, and under Donald Trump is unwilling to finance the military umbrella over Europe,” he said, adding that this was only one reason that led to the plan. “On the other hand, the EU is realizing that subordinating itself to the US is increasingly a game of diminishing returns,” the expert noted. He cited the example of Ukraine, believing that France, Germany and other European countries “had no interest in starting a trade war with Russia … but the US maneuvered them into doing it.” “If they [the EU] want to act independently, if they want to stop being used … then they are going to have to strike on their own,” Glazebrook concluded.

              "  'The Morton County Sheriff’s Office said about 50 law enforcement police responded to events the site near Glen Ullin Tuesday after construction workers said they had been “swarmed” by protesters and that two people had “attached” themselves to equipment. Currently 2 lockdowns in place on DAPL construction by white allies standing in solidairty  w/ Standing Rock #noDAPLpic.twitter.com/Qh18fnogT5 The protesters face charges of criminal trespassing, and the two attached to equipment faces charges of hindering law enforcement and disorderly conduct, according to the Sheriff’s spokeswoman, Donnell Preskey, according to AP. The site near Glen Ullin is not part of the temporary work stoppage ordered by the federal judge or the section the federal government asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on last Friday. Hundreds of people from over 200 indigenous nations have gathered in the area to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which claimed in a lawsuit filed against federal regulators that the oil pipeline would harm water supplies and disturb sacred burial and cultural sites. The lawsuit challenges the Army Corps of Engineers’ decision to grant about 200 permits at water crossings for the pipeline. For now, the federal government has issued a temporary halt to construction on Army Corps land around and underneath Lake Oahe, one of six reservoirs on the Missouri River. Three federal agencies also asked Energy Transfer Partners for a “voluntary pause” in work for 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe. “We are dealing with a world that doesn’t understand who we are,” Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told RT. “It is time, it is really time, for the world to understand that there is something deeper than this Western-type of development that continues to take and take out of Mother Earth without giving back.” Goldtooth from the Navajo Nation said there is a “tremendous need for the world to re-evaluate its own understanding of nature, its own understanding of its relationship to Mother Earth.” “Those are some of the things that are part of this whole convergence here is around a system’s change, not climate change, and especially how we work together, interact with each other, nation to nation, as indigenous nations and colonial nations,” said Goldtooth. “It is a new chapter, that is what is happening here, a new convergence for a new chapter and how we communicate, and how we respect each other and how North Dakota as a state of the United States government how it communicates much better policies of consultation what exist now.” The head of Energy Transfer Partners told employees in a memo Tuesday that it was committed to the project despite strong opposition and a federal order to voluntarily halt construction near Stand Rock Sioux tribe reservation in North Dakota. “I am confident that as long as the government ultimately decides the fate of the project based on science and engineering, the Dakota Access Pipeline will become operational…So we will continue to obey the rules and trust the process,” Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, wrote to employees, according to Associated Press. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and the thousands of others who have gathered at the southern North Dakota site won’t budge. “People are still coming down here and are committed to stopping the project,” he told AP. Energy Transfer Partners are developing a $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, that once completed would travel through four states. The 1,172-mile project would carry nearly a half-million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota’s oil fields through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Illinois.  '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Before we go any further, I should clarify that I'm no fan of Donald Trump, and like most people, I believed Clinton would win, so this isn't an opportunity to say 'I told you so.' Nevertheless, it was always clear that Clinton's campaign strategy had some serious flaws. Most of us thought this would simply make it a tight race, but that Clinton would undoubtedly pull through. Now, however, the events of the aftermath – on top of the obvious mistakes already made – make the reasons Trump pulled off the shock victory clearer than ever.  Liberals for Clinton spent this election doing three things that were entirely counter-productive and which now they should regret. READ MORE: How Trump won the White House: Key moments of #Election2016 First, they ran a campaign which based itself less on issues and more on the fact that Trump doesn't appear to be a very nice person. Now, while this may be true and even seemed like a logical strategy at times (during p*ssy-grabbing-gate, for example), ultimately it's not how you win over or inspire people. Second, instead of debating and engaging with people, a huge chunk of Hillary supporters decided anyone who didn't agree with them was a racist, sexist, uneducated waste of oxygen. In fact, their own candidate even appeared to back them up in this line of thinking by calling Trump supporters “deplorables.” Instead of sucking it up and realizing that their Trump friends had the right to an opinion – and were not necessarily racist and sexist – these overly sensitive souls ran off to their “safe spaces” where differing opinions couldn't reach them. This led to a lot of unfriending on Facebook, and probably a significant chunk of secret Trump voters who came out only in the privacy of the voting booth. As such, the polls that Clinton relied on to read the country's mood were almost all wrong. The refusal to acknowledge Trump supporters as human beings with their own, perhaps legitimate, reasons for favoring him was a major failure of the Clinton camp. This is much the same thing that happened in the UK with the Brexit vote. Look at the #BasketOfDeplorables in Pensacola Florida last night! What a horrible statement. #CrookedHillarypic.twitter.com/GfevT0KUjd Third, they played the blame game in a way that really backfired “big-league,” as Trump would say. If Trump's support had to be acknowledged, it must be blamed on anyone but Clinton or the status quo of American politics which she was trying to protect. Their favorite strategy in this regard was to blame Russia. This was odd because most Americans probably don't give a flying toss about Russia, but Vladimir Putin became the “secret mastermind” behind Trump's successes, not the fact that millions of ordinary Americans were hurting and feeling left behind and ignored by decades of policies which never seemed to take them into account. Julian Assange and WikiLeaks\\xa0were Putin's puppets, too. And so was Green Party candidate Jill Stein. They were all part of a massive Kremlin plot, you see. That's what you would have believed if you'd listened to some Clinton surrogates and fans in the media. It was real 'Russia ate my homework' level stuff – and it has likely flamed the fury of Clinton's supporters trying to come to terms with how they lost. Not surprisingly, the blame game has continued in the aftermath of Clinton's loss, but now the main culprit is the Electoral College system, which has suddenly become the major focus of Clinton supporters who last week were perfectly happy with it. Last chance? #Clinton supporters petition to force Electoral College to vote for her December 19 https://t.co/U4pa0EtrUJ Only the popular vote matters, they say. Clinton's loss isn't fair, they cry. Millions of them have signed petitions trying to have Clinton elected anyway. Unfortunately for the disappointed, signing petitions isn't how you elect a president – and it is truly fascinating how quickly liberals who love democracy seem to forget all about it when their candidate loses. Ask them if they would be complaining about the Electoral College and its fairness if Clinton had won and they quickly go quiet. There's another parallel here to the Brexit vote and how pro-EU voters tried to annul the majority's choice on the grounds that they were the “stupid masses.” Then there's the protesters; the people who have actually taken to the streets to dispute the outcome of a legitimate election simply because they don't fancy dealing with the result. The rather ironic theme seems to be: Trump is an evil fascist who hates democracy and will destroy America, so we need to violently overthrow him. Now, protesting is fine, it's their right to do so. Many people are legitimately worried about the kind of era Trump will usher in. But there's a kind of hypocrisy to it as well. If you asked these liberal anti-Trump protesters why they weren't out protesting Obama's drone war, or his funding of terrorists in Syria, or Hillary's hand in the destruction of Libya, they'd barely know what you're talking about – which brings us finally to the media and its role in all of this. Liberals weren't bothered by most of these things because the media told them not to be. Bombings under Obama were humanitarian airstrikes. The mainstream media made anti-war liberals fine with war because a nice man with a pretty family was dropping the bombs. Journalists and pundits became so entrenched in their own perspective and bubble that they couldn't even mask their disbelief and anger over the outcome on election night. Literally until moments before the race was called for Trump, anchors and pundits were talking about Clinton's path to 270 delegates when, to anyone facing reality, it had been clear hours before that she probably didn't have one. Trump's victory is beyond comprehension for Clinton supporters and the media because for so long they've failed to live in the real world where there are two sides to every story. There's a lesson there for anyone who wants to take it.

In December 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law allowing Rosneft and Novatek to export LNG. As a result, Gazprom and its subsidiary Gazprom Export lost the exclusive right to ship LNG abroad. The law is opposed by Gazprom.

The Syrian people remain the losing party in this game,” Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily. He added that it was Russia that had prioritized the humanitarian aspects of the operation from the very beginning and that the Russian military and Emergencies Ministry have never ceased delivering humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians. READ MORE: Most Russians reject US criticism of air force’s anti-terrorist operation in Syria – poll In the interview, Patrushev stressed that Al-Nusra Front, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, is just as dangerous as the infamous Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), and that renaming it into “Jabhat Fateh al-Sham” had not automatically turned it into some kind of “moderate opposition.” “Whatever the name of a terrorist group, when it uses terrorist tactics, it should not be given a place at the negotiation table, it should be destroyed,” he said. The Russian security chief also pointed to Washington’s inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to fulfill its obligation to distance Al-Nusra Front terrorists from the so-called “moderate opposition,” which it had agreed to do in the ceasefire deal reached with Russia, as the main problem standing in the way of the anti-terrorist operation. “We have recent examples proving that the US side is not keeping its promises. Like, despite the fact that the Syrian government has withdrawn its forces from the Castello road, the moderate opposition supported by Washington has not only failed to take any similar steps – they have been blocking the humanitarian convoys sent along it by the United Nations.” READ MORE: ‘Agony of departing administration’: Russian senate leader blasts US position on Syria Other examples of the US’ interference, according to Patrushev, was its attack on Syrian forces on September 17 and using talks with Russia to allow the terrorists to regroup. “Today we can witness the result of their actions – more and more Syrian groups that had worked with the USA earlier are now merging into Al-Nusra Front.”Washington’s recent announcement that it was breaking off all talks with Moscow on Syria underscores the US’ double standards, Patrushev told reporters. At the same time, the Russian security chief said that officials in Moscow still hope a constructive approach will eventually prevail in Washington and are ready to look at proposals on normalizing the situation in Aleppo. “Terrorism has never respected national borders. What is going on in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Afghanistan today, tomorrow can be replayed in other countries,” Patrushev concluded. On Tuesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that the Russian and Syrian air forces would halt their airstrikes on terrorists in Aleppo to allow for a 48-hour humanitarian pause. The ceasefire comes two days ahead of plan, as the delivery of aid to the city was to start on Thursday. “The goal of this work is to separate the terrorist from the ‘moderate opposition’ and get them out of eastern Aleppo,” Shoigu said.

              "  'Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for a drastic change in European policy towards Russia. Instead of seeking for a major role in NATO’s buildup against Russia in Eastern Europe and in the Baltics, Berlin should do its utmost to improve relations with Moscow. It was therefore a “serious mistake” that Germany assumed leadership over NATO troops near Russia’s borders “right on the [75th] anniversary of the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941,” Schroeder said at a German Chamber of Commerce event in Austria, as cited by the Salzburger Nachrichten\\xa0newspaper. Moscow calls NATO buildup in E. Europe ‘unjustified’ as largest drills since Cold War kick off https://t.co/4IThutir73 The date of the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union, June 22, is marked in Russia annually to pay tribute to war victims and Red Army soldiers killed or missing in action. Schroeder has also said that “overall, the EU needs Russia and Turkey in terms of security policy,” once again showing discontent with Washington, which sees Moscow’s “assertiveness” as a threat to NATO’s Eastern European members. If the German government wants the sanctions to be prolonged, “it must not be afraid of explaining this to its population,” Schroeder asserted. In 2014, Crimea seceded from Ukraine following a coup in Kiev, and chose to be reunified with Russia after a referendum. Following the events, the EU imposed economic sanctions on Russia, which targeted major energy corporations, state-owned banks and senior officials. Despite growing resistance inside the bloc and repeated calls from European businesses to lift the sanctions, it is expected that they will remain in place for at least another six months. As part of the Eastern European deployment, NATO plans to station four battalions of up to 1,000 troops each in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. The US is likely to command two battalions, with Britain and Germany taking another each. The German contribution would also include setting up command structures as well as providing logistical support and cyber defense. The deployment aside, NATO is training thousands of troops in a number of exercises that take place near Russian borders. Earlier in June, the largest war games in Europe since the Cold War called Anaconda 2016 started in Poland. They involve over 31,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles from 24 countries, and it is for the first time since the Nazi invasion of Poland that German tanks have crossed the country eastwards. The scenario so far included an airdrop of 1,130 parachutists over the northern Polish city of Torun on Tuesday, involving 500 US and 230 British troops, as well as engineers building a bridge to carry 300 vehicles over the Vistula River and a night-time helicopter “assault” of 35 aircraft. Other regional drills, such as BALTOPS and Saber Strike, are taking place in the Baltic simultaneously with Anaconda 2016. Moscow says it will seek an adequate response to increased NATO presence in close proximity to Russian borders, forming two more army divisions in the west and one in the south. Top officials maintain that it is rather NATO’s “practical actions,” not the bloc’s existence as an organization that poses a threat to Russia. '],\n",

The chairwoman says that the idea “HFA,” or Hillary For America, originally proposed the idea of using Israel/Palestine as “an ideal issue to marginalize Sanders on,” suggesting that the DNC were exchanging communications about anti-Sanders strategies with the Clinton campaign. The DNC also appears to have made a secret “agreement” with Kenneth Vogel, an influential report for Politico. An email from late April with the subject line \"per agreement... any thoughts appreciated\" shows that Vogel sent an advanced copy of a story about Hillary Clinton’s fundraising to the DNC even before his editor even saw it. “Vogel gave me his story ahead of time/before it goes to his editors as long as I didn\\'t share it,” DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach wrote to\\xa0 Miranda. “Let me know if you see anything that\\'s missing and I\\'ll push back.” The published version of the story did not appear to have any significant edits from and was not favorable to the Clinton campaign, but the sending of a full, advanced copy to the subject of a story is considered to be a violation of journalistic ethics. A source with familiar with the interaction between Politico and the DNC told RT America that the message was sent to officials to ensure accuracy in the story, and that it would have been difficult to ask for piecemeal clarifications due to its complexity. The “agreement,” in fact, referred to the DNC promising not to pass the story to a more favorable news outlet who might publish before\\xa0 Politco. Another email released in the Friday leak indicates that the DNC was in close contact with news websites on articles related to the Democratic Party. A Real Clear Politics article said that Sanders supporters were causing a lack of unity at the Nevada Democratic Convention. “This headline needs to be changed,”\\xa0 Wasserman Schultz wrote to Miranda. “We need to push back... Patrice, what happened, DNC had nothing to do with this, right?” Miranda replied, referring to DNC Director of Party Affairs Patrice Taylor. Taylor responded saying that the article should be changed the event was run by the state party and the disorder “sounds like internal issues amount [sic] Sanders supporters.” “Walter, please connect with Stewart and get him to push back,” Miranda wrote. The last email on the thread says: “Done. Article has been updated.” Plotting against Sanders In a May 5 email, two top DNC executives plotted a smear against Sanders by drawing his Jewish faith into question and painting him as an atheist in strongly religious states. READ MORE: New Hillary leak: Wikileaks releases 20K DNC emails “It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief,” DNC Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall wrote. “Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.” “AMEN,” DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy K. Dacey replied. Want to see inside how a counter-revolutionary party squashes a revolutionary campaign? Follow @wikileaks and #DNCLeaks. We must fight on. In an\\xa0email that concerned Sanders out-polling Clinton in Rhode Island, where\\xa0the state reportedly only had a fraction of voting stations open, one staffer took a contemptuous tone of Sanders’ supporters,\\xa0 speaking about them more as a nuisance than an arm of the party. “If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct,” the staffer writes, “They’ll probably complain regardless, actually.” Another email shows similar \\'us and them\\' language being directed at Sanders supporters. “We have the Sanders folks admitting that they lost fair and square, not because we \\'rigged\\' anything,” the email said. “Clinton likely to win the state convention with a slim margin and we\\'ll send a release with final delegate numbers.” An email titled \\'Bernie narrative\\' sent by DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach to Miranda indicates that top officials in the party were trying to find an angle to disparage the Vermont senator in the media. “Wondering if there\\'s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,” Paustenbach wrote in the May 21 message. “Specifically, [Debbie Wasserman Schultz] had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign to do things because they\\'d either ignored or forgotten to something critical.” “It\\'s not a DNC conspiracy, it\\'s because they never had their act together,”\\xa0Paustenbach suggested. Writing off Bernie Wasserman Schultz seemed to have already counted Sanders out of the race in a May 21 email, when there were still nine primaries to go. “This is a silly story,” the chairwoman said. “He isn\\'t going to be president.” In another email, Paustenbach informed her that Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the candidate should continue to the convention, Wasserman Shultz said: “He is an ASS,” referring to Weaver. The chairwoman made her opinion clear about Sanders in an message concerning the candidate alleging that the party hadn’t been fair to him. “Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do,” she said. Not that anyone was ever confused about Wasserman Schultz\\'s barely-concealed efforts to undermine Sanders, but... pic.twitter.com/Oq6swKN5H2 There seems to be clear bias in the aggregate as well. Searches of the database shows an apparent bias by DNC officials against Sanders just by how closely either campaign was monitored. A search of “Sanders supporters” yields 306 messages, while a search of “Clinton supporters” shows only 65 results. A search of “his campaign” yields 780 messages, while “her campaign” only brings up a paltry 120 results. '],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'As the two major US political parties have officially selected their nominees for president, Chris Hedges, host of RT’s On Contact program, discussed with the Green Party candidate for president, Dr. Jill Stein, what could be an alternative way forward. According to Dr Stein, in the current presidential race, the American public is “clamoring for something else at unprecedented levels”. “People have rejected not only both of these parties, which are minority parties by actual polling…Their candidates are running at record levels, all time highest for people disliking the Democratic and Republican candidates,” she said. “The American people and the people all over the world are being thrown under the bus by this political system…in which both parties are basically funded by and controlled by predatory banks, by fossil-fuel giants, by war-profiteers, the health insurance industry - the usual suspects who are calling the shots from behind the closed doors,” Stein says. Stein says that since her campaign and the Green Party “are the only candidates and party” that do not take money from corporations and lobbyists, and do not have super PACs, they have “the liberty to address the crises” that the US people are facing. Speaking about the frontrunners, the Green Party candidate noted that if you “look at the track record, the terrible things that Donald Trump says – which are truly reprehensible and horrific – have actually been done by Hillary Clinton”. For example, she said, “on immigrants, xenophobia and hate mongering, we’ve learned that Trump and the Republicans are the party of hate and fear”. But, Stein went on, “the Democrats are the party of deportation, detentions, and night raids”. And the night-raiding is carried out against the women and children “who are feeling the violence that Hillary Clinton herself gave the thumbs up to with this horrific corporate coup in Honduras”. US policies very much promoted by “Clinton herself are generating these refugees, which she then, and the Democrats, are criminalizing when they get here and sending them back,” says Stein. Speaking about security issues - “finger on nuclear button”, as she put it, the Green Party candidate noted that Trump makes “irresponsible statements” and Clinton advocates the enforcing of a no-fly zone over Syria “against a nuclear armed country that is Russia.” Clinton has already been antagonizing Russia by surrounding it with missile bases and soldiers, Stein said. “How would we feel if Russian troops were amassing on the border of Mexico and Canada?” she added.\\xa0 Dr Stein has called Donald Trump “a product” of economic misery, which created vulnerability, fear, and sense of dread on behalf of the American worker and middle class, “to whom adversity is somewhat new”. “They become very vulnerable to demagoguery, to wishful memory about ‘how we can recreate a powerful America of the past’,” she said. But not much is being asked about what caused this misery. In Stein’s opinion, this goes back to Wall Street deregulation “and the economic crash” that resulted in disappearance of millions of jobs, “stole five million homes out from under home owners, and to NAFTA which basically allowed a million jobs and more to be sent overseas and for wages to be pushed downward.” The Wall Street deregulation passed by Bill Clinton was advocated for and celebrated by Hillary Clinton, she said. “So, putting another Clinton in the White House – that’s not a solution; that was the problem, that is only going to fan the flames of right-wing extremism,” Stein said.  The real solution would be economic investments in a form of a Green New Deal like the one that got the US out of the Great Depression and job-creation, the Green Party candidate said. “This is not a kind of pie in the sky that we can fix this. The real solution here is economic investment; it’s job creation; it’s not wish fulfilment about how Donald Trump is going to cut a better deal for us. Donald Trump leaves a lake of bankruptcies and lawsuits behind him from workers who’ve been cheated, and jobs that have been sent overseas. So, Big Daddy is not the Big Daddy that we need,” she said.\\xa0 The Green Party, she insists, can grow the economy in a just and sustainable way. Her campaign suggests cancelling the student debt that affected about 40 million people “like we cancelled the debt for the Wall Street crooks who crashed the economy.” “If we bailed out the crooks, it’s time to bail out their victims through the same tool of quantitative easing that doesn’t cost taxpayers a thing…” Jill Stein said. \\xa0\\xa0 The US spends a trillion dollars a year on its military, says Jill Stein. If that budget is cut it in half, the American economy will have the money it needs at home to provide for free public higher education, insure any health costs that aren’t covered already and work with other countries to address the problem of climate change – which remains one of the crucial problems globally, she believes.\\xa0 “Few people know what we pay for this catastrophic military which shoots first and asks questions later. In fact, what we have is a foreign policy which is essentially a marketing strategy for selling weapons,” she said. “We’ve had these wars for oil - which are opportunities to sell weapons and to come and dear other people’s fossil fuel resources, which is basically what our military is doing.\\xa0Why do we have a thousand bases for a hundred countries around the world?\\xa0 This isn’t something that other countries do.” The reason why the US keeps doing so is to safeguard its energy supplies and their routes of transportation, Stein says. “This can no longer be justified – it’s all obsolete when we have a Green New Deal, which will reach 100 percent wind, water and sun clean renewable energy entirely by 2030. So, we can begin phasing down this network and stop stealing other people’s oil right now,” she said. The US spent six trillion dollars on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq – both of which failed, the presidential candidate said. The US killed a million people in Iraq alone, “not winning the hearts and minds of people in the Middle East to say the least. And what do we have for it? Failed states, mass refuge migrations that are tearing apart Europe as well as the Middle East, and creating worse terrorist threats,” she added.

Should Sputnik and RT employees be accredited as journalists or as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? I don’t know. But we need to know,” wrote the former ambassador. At the same time, McFaul appears to have a grudging respect for RT’s power, if not its content. RT does serve the interests of the Kremlin effectively.

              "  \" Brent crude, which is used as a basis for the price of the country's main export Urals blend gained 22 percent this month, while the Russian ruble strengthened by only four percent against the US dollar. The favorable exchange rate allows the government to gain from sales of dollar-denominated oil. Russia’s 2016 fiscal plan was based on the government getting 3,165 rubles ($48.61) for each barrel of crude it sells. In January, the price tumbled to 2,245 ($34.48). The current recovery in oil prices helps the government bridge the budget gap. “The ruble lagged oil on its way down, and now it’s lagging on the rebound,” Konstantin Artemov, a money manager at Raiffeisen Asset Management in Moscow told Bloomberg, adding that the equilibrium price was about 3,000 rubles ($46.07) a barrel. Russia won’t be able to keep its target budget deficit at three percent of gross domestic product this year, according to First Deputy Finance Minister Tatiana Nesterenko. The share of earnings from energy exports in the state budget shrank to almost a third in the first quarter. Several years ago it amounted to more than 50 percent.

Russian oil companies pay most of their expenses in domestic currency (a weak ruble) while getting hard currency (a strong US dollar) for their product. The Kremlin has the option to force Russian oil companies to sell more of their dollar revenues and increase taxes. This would solve two problems. Converting dollars to rubles would strengthen the domestic currency and extra taxes would fill the budget holes. Putin wants to ax dollar from Russian trade https://t.co/JqfgHLX2HTpic.twitter.com/rguTcWGtki Other oil producers may not be as fortunate. Despite falling oil prices, Saudi Arabia is refusing to cut crude output in order to defend its market share. Riyadh is hoping to squeeze out its competitors, primarily the US and Russia. But that's a dangerous game as Saudi Arabia is at risk of depleting its financial assets within five years. In a move that some see as Moscow calling Riyadh's bluff, Russia's Finance Ministry announced in December that it is drawing up plans based on the price of oil as low as $30 a barrel until 2022. That scenario would have devastating implications for OPEC, according to Russia's Deputy Finance Minister Maxim Oreshkin. The economies of less affluent OPEC states are struggling with low oil prices. Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela, have been calling for production cuts in order to increase prices. On the other side of the Atlantic, the prospect of Washington lifting its four-decade ban on oil exports seems like another game changer for Russia. However, American crude producers may not be willing to export oil if the price stays low. If a barrel is more expensive to produce than the market price, it is more likely that US oil companies will slow production and stay on the domestic market. Worst of crisis over for Russia, but country needs to adjust to life with cheap oil - #Putinhttps://t.co/lPas89yZLcpic.twitter.com/GW8vbZUvQ6 However, the Kremlin is facing it's own domestic battle. Russian oil majors are opposed to the Finance Ministry's plan to dip in to their war chest. According to Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, stripping oil companies of extra revenue means leaving Russia’s key economic sector without money for development. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov wants oil companies to pay three times more in taxes than they pay currently – 600 billion rubles instead of the current 200 billion. According to Siluanov, without “devaluation extractions” the budget deficit would grow, making the government borrow and withdraw resources from the private sector and raising rates.\\xa0 The more the oil sector gets, the less goes to others, he said. Another possible move for Moscow to fill the budget is to depreciate the ruble against Western currencies. However, ruble depreciation is a direct way to skyrocketing inflation, reducing domestic incomes and consumer demand - one of the biggest problems for the Russian economy in 2015. And the Kremlin’s target for this year is to cut inflation to 6.4 percent from more than 12 percent in 2015. \"],\n",

Under tremendous assault from the American establishment media over the proliferation of what they define as ’fake news’ on the platform, internet behemoth Facebook has finally caved in and agreed to regulate content. While, in principle, the concept sounds relatively noble, the manner in which it\\'s proposed to implement it merits many questions. Among them are the continuing dangers of American domination of the world wide web and the liberal bias of that country’s popular press. But most worrying is the uncharted territory we are entering. Because there has never been a media portal as dominant as Facebook. In the past, big broadcasters or newsagent chains might have enjoyed outsized influence, but Mark Zuckerbeg’s firm is an effective monopoly. CIA meddled in ‘hundreds’ of elections: Ron Paul talks Russia-blaming, fake news and more on RThttps://t.co/qxttAcpYSmpic.twitter.com/1kd44g8AVH Whereas papers have always been curated by editors, their power was limited by the sheer number of competitors in every national market. And the more different they were, the better for society in general. However, there is only one Facebook, and its power, in this regard, is extraordinary. Of course, another big problem here is that one person’s “fake news” could be another’s truth. And that’s before we mention how some of the outlets pressuring Facebook are often guilty of making up stories themselves. To filter content, Facebook has joined up with Poynter, an self-proclaimed “international fact-checking network,” which presents itself as a neutral body with great integrity. Yet, a cursory glance at its funding sources is enough to set alarm bells ringing. They include Pierre Omidyar, George Soros\\xa0and Washington’s National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA soft-power cutout. As it happens, regular RT readers will remember these three as the primary foreign backers of Ukraine’s Maidan coup in 2014. Thus, it’s clear that this project could easily wind up as some sort of “ministry of truth” with only organizations who adhere to liberal Washington’s official line permitted unfettered access to Facebook’s primary news feeds. And this is very dangerous. Facebook up to the facts: Social network, third party fact-checkers to sort out ‘fake news’https://t.co/jZmZXrpl06pic.twitter.com/X6uf2LKfdh Additionally, the fact that Poynter’s sponsors, which also include Bill Gates and Google, almost uniformly supported Hillary Clinton in the recent US election is very troubling. Because it’s another indication of how, having endured a series of electoral setbacks this year, the globalist elite is now effectively trying to block out dissenting voices. That said, nobody is disputing whether “fake news” is a problem. It’s just hard to find agreement on its definition. For instance, very few in the west would define the Washington Post, Guardian, Daily Telegraph or New York Times as providers of fictional reportage, but viewed from Moscow it\\'s often a different story. Only last month, WaPo accused 200 non-mainstream sites of acting on behalf of the Kremlin, in a story which has been definitively debunked by numerous\\xa0credible sources. And, just last week, the NYT carried a front page story alleging that Vladimir Putin\\xa0was using “kompromat” to destroy the reputations of his political opponents. For \\'proof\\' they used the case of Vladimir Bukovsky, who was being investigated by British police over possession of child pornography. German politicians want €500k fines if Facebook fails to remove fake news within 24hrs https://t.co/VSGNiA2M98pic.twitter.com/3YY4Dwk003 The paper\\'s readers were greeted with this soft-soap intro from correspondent Andrew Higgins: “His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K.G.B. and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride.” And to back up his yarn, Higgins made a series of unsubstantiated claims linking Russian state meddling to other similar schemes. Yet, sadly for Higgins - and Bukovsky, of course - his hero admitted a few days later that he actually collected the child porn images\\xa0himself, as \"research.\" Then there’s the Guardian, where its former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding has been alleging for years that Putin is the richest man in Europe, if not on earth. A statement that is frequently repeated in similar outlets, where his fortune - without any explanation - suddenly leaped from $40 billion to $200 billion recently, according to the same Washington Post. These journals of renown base their figures on a single, very shaky, source. And we can’t forget the Daily Telegraph, which appears to have given up on using professional journalists to cover Russia, and has produced some right porkies in recent times. Including outrageous stuff like Putin jetting to Switzerland, incognito, to oversee the birth of a love child\\xa0and Moscow developing a Star Trek-esque teleportation device.\\xa0 Are all these not examples of “fake news?” But given that they are establishment names in the western press, don’t expect Poynter to subject them to the same treatment as newer alternative outlets. And this is the problem with the entire exercise. Credible or fake? Journalists clash in fiery RT debate on news sources in #Syria (VIDEO) https://t.co/ibunqPmH1Vpic.twitter.com/qLtwXN45j7 The list of signatories to the International Fact-Checking\\xa0Network also sets alarm bells ringing. For they include some fairly dubious organizations. Take Politifact, for example. This group has been accused of having a left-wing bias and openly favoring Clinton during the US election campaign. As Breitbart observed: “When Trump said Clinton wants “open borders,” PolitiFact deemed his statement “mostly false” — despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013. “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” she said at the time.” ‘Intolerable & dangerous’: #Auschwitz Committee accuses #Facebook of turning blind eye to hate speech https://t.co/GGY63iSnbTpic.twitter.com/YKcwlOujvk There is no doubt that blatantly made up, let alone poorly fact-checked, stories are poisoning political discourse. And Facebook is right to tackle the type of companies who produce twaddle such as “Hillary invented the Aids virus” or “Trump wants to distribute Mein Kampf to school kids\" or whatever nonsense is being pushed today. However, will it also censure “respected” mainstream outlets who allege that Putin has stolen $200 billion for himself or is planting child porn on dissidents? Because unless they are also labelled with the “fake news” badge, this looks more like an exercise in the US liberal establishment trying to gain control of the distribution of news on social media, as they once did with newspapers and broadcasters.

The US still has “a ways to go” in defeating IS, which “still has a lot of momentum,” Brennan argued. “This country has done a great job since 9/11 making the American homeland much more difficult for terrorist organizations abroad to penetrate,” Brennan added, but Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS/ISIL) is pushing its narrative online, and the takeaway from the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando is that individuals who decide to act can do a lot of damage before law enforcement and intelligence agencies can flag them as terrorists. Most terrorist attacks are directed out of the group’s strongholds in Iraq and Syria, and addressing the threat requires collective, combined effort against both “upstream” leadership and “downstream” dissemination of instructions, Brennan said. During the question-and-answer period, the CIA director argued that he did not disagree with the White House when he testified before the Senate two weeks ago that “our efforts have not reduced the group's terrorism capability and global reach,” of IS. “I’m hard pressed to think about where President Obama and I differ on this issue,” Brennan said. Asked about rooting out IS in Syria, the CIA director repeated the administration’s assertion that the government in Damascus was somehow responsible for the terror group’s rise. He acknowledged, however, that Moscow’s actions in Syria were motivated by a desire to defeat terrorists. President Obama and the US State Department have previously accused Russia of not fighting IS, but propping up the “Assad regime.” The US was working on “getting the trajectory of the Syrian conflict on a better course,” Brennan said, adding that it won’t be resolved on the battlefield. “There’s going to be no way forward on the political front without Russian cooperation,” he added. \"],\n",

              "  \"Asked whether they favored or opposed hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as a means of increasing the production of natural gas or oil in the US, 36 percent of respondents said they were in favor, while 51 percent said they were opposed and 13 percent had no opinion, according to the new Gallup poll released on Wednesday. New Gallup Poll: opposition to Fracking Mounts in the U.S., now 51% -- up from 40% last year https://t.co/Jd1dEshZDhpic.twitter.com/MXfgeN0V3y That is an 11 point increase in opposition since last year. Answering the same question in 2015, 40 percent of Americans were in favor and 40 percent were opposed, while 19 percent had no opinion. The poll was conducted between March 2 and March 6. Noting the six point decrease in Americans who had no opinion of the technology, Gallup noted that that could partially account for the rise in opposition to fracking, as a result of the term becoming “more commonplace in the culture, or as the media has more extensively covered the arguments for and against fracking.” Increased opposition could also come from the low oil prices, greater energy independence, and a turn towards alternative, sustainable energy sources, Gallup noted. “Americans’ turn against fracking comes as the percentage predicting there will be a critical energy shortage in the next five years has fallen to a new low because of lower gas prices. With oil and gas relatively cheap, many Americans may not see the need to fracture the earth through fracking,” said the polling agency. This should worry US shale drillers: Gallup poll shows 51% oppose fracking with just 36% in favor https://t.co/0pJp4zO09y The poll also found that Republicans are not as supportive of fracking in 2016, with only 55 percent in favor compared to 66 percent last year. There was not as much change among the Democrats, with 25 percent in favor this year compared to 26 percent in 2015. Fracking has become a contentious topic in American life. The method has provided great opportunities for the nation’s crude oil producers, with half of US oil production currently acquired through fracking compared to just 2 percent in 2000. US reliance on domestic supply, however, has caused a global tug of war with Saudi Arabia, which has been driving down the price of oil to try and make fracking too expensive in the US. A number of US companies have folded as the oil prices bottomed out. Fracking-caused earthquakes put 7 million Americans at risk – USGShttps://t.co/UeVQ8igD0ypic.twitter.com/XqgqVBVaJ7 Environmentalists blame fracking for earthquakes across sections of the country which are typically tremor-free. Last year there were more than 1,000 earthquakes in central US. This week, the US Geological Survey said 7 million Americans are at risk of experiencing earthquakes caused by fracking in the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. The same survey said the state of Oklahoma had a one in eight chance of experiencing earthquakes surpassing the state of California. There are 4,500 oil and gas wells in Oklahoma, and 3,200 are operational daily. “Induced quakes have become more frequent because there’s more wastewater from oil and gas operations around the country that has to be disposed of,” Mark Peterson, seismic hazard expert at USGS, told National Public Radio. “Companies pump it down into underground well, and sometimes that water raises pressure on underground faults that then slip and cause small quakes.” It is not just the threat earthquakes that has people in opposition to the method but also pollution to groundwater. Earlier this month a federal jury ordered Cabot Oil & Gas to pay more than $4.24 million in damages to two families in Dimock, Pennsylvania, who claimed the company's fracking operations contaminated their groundwater with methane. The verdict comes at the end of a long-running federal case that pitted Dimock homeowners against Cabot, one of the largest gas drillers in Pennsylvania. State regulators blamed faulty gas wells drilled by the company for leaking combustible methane into Dimock's groundwater. The company argued the methane was occurring naturally. ’Gasland’ families win $4.24mn fracking lawsuithttps://t.co/UiGuSMpCKSpic.twitter.com/iWxGhKA87D More than 40 families have sued Cabot since they began fracking to extract natural gas from underground shale formations near Dimock in 2008. Most of the families settled with the company in 2012. The plight of families in Dimock was featured in Gasland, the Emmy-winning 2010 documentary by Josh Fox. \"],\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'Nahed’s crime? Sharing a cartoon on Facebook that depicted a depraved extremist issuing orders to a meek God. He didn’t draw the caricature himself – he simply shared it. And he nuanced the post with an important caveat: that this was “ISIS’ God” – not Islam’s. This is the first time in memory that a Jordanian journalist has been murdered for his views, and it has shaken up a country that prides itself on ‘security’ amidst a neighborhood rife with instability and violence. The killer, 49 year-old Riad Abdallah, has a checkered past. Nahed’s family said they have learned Abdallah used to fight in Iraq with Al-Qaeda, but was “rehabilitated” upon his return, eventually gaining employment with two government ministries, the Ministry of Awqaf (Endowment and Islamic Affairs) – an unpaid gig – and the ministry of education, where he received a salary and housing. In addition, this known extremist was a part-time preacher at two mosques in Amman. But Nahed’s brother Majed Hattar says the family’s fight isn’t with the killer, who is a “little thing” in a much larger picture. Instead, says Majed, with focused fury: “The bullets that killed Nahed Hattar were shot on the day the prime minister gave the order to arrest Nahed Hattar.” The family is currently assembling a lawsuit to charge various government officials and other entities/individuals for causing Nahed harm and for contributing to the incitement that led to his death. Among these are the prime minister of Jordan Hani al-Mulki, the interior minister Salameh Hammad, the Amman Governor Khaled Abu Zeid, and the head of general security. But it isn’t just the government they blame. Nahed’s family also holds responsible religious authorities – both Muslim and Christian – who fanned the flames almost immediately after he posted the now infamous cartoon on Facebook. Within hours of the post, Al Sabeel, a Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) publication ran a screenshot on its website, censoring the images and language they viewed to be offensive – but more importantly, blacking out Nahed’s explanation that this was “ISIS’ God,” not Islam’s. The Al Sabeel piece went viral, but readers could not even see the content of the caricature or Nahed’s important caveat. A few hours later, Prime Minister Mulki instructed his interior minister to arrest Nahed – his 16th arrest by authorities since 1979. A government statement accused him of “inciting sectarian strife” and “insulting religion.” This, the family believes, was the action that emboldened Nahed’s critics – the ones who sought violent reprisals. What followed takes a big whack at Jordan’s claims to the rule of law and justice. Nahed was incarcerated for a month, during which time – his family says - he was severely mistreated. His sister Kawkab explains that Nahed was beaten so badly by security services in 1998 that he had to have several operations on his stomach, including the removal of two meters of his intestines. “He took medication for this and remained on a special diet until the end,” she says, but was neglected so badly in prison that he ended up in hospital twice during his month-long term. On both occasions, Nahed was handcuffed and shackled to and from the Al Bashir government hospital. The first time, his situation worsened to the extent that Nahed asked to be returned to his prison cell. When the family appealed for help from Amnesty International and the Red Cross, four doctors were brought in to examine Nahed and agreed that he needed special treatment. But instead, when the doctors left, Kawkab says “they ripped out his IVs, left the needle in his arm, cuffed his hands and feet and placed him in a hospital prison cell. They even put a sign at the base of his bed that read ‘dangerous criminal’.” On the outside, social media exploded with exactly the kind of incitement against Nahed that officials had accused him of fomenting. Possibly emboldened by the government’s swift reaction against him, Jordanians took to Twitter and Facebook, threatening Nahed’s life and even offering bounties for several body parts, including his tongue. They did so using their real accounts, with real identities – yet none of them were arrested for incitement. Upon his release, a trial date was set for two weeks later, on September 25. Nahed and his family requested protection, but were denied this and told they would need to get their own security. And then on the first day of the trial, Nahed was shot dead in front of his sons and brothers and dozens of bystanders and policemen at the Palace of Justice. While various authorities immediately condemned the killing of Nahed Hattar, as the day wore on, Jordanians noted shocking scenes of jubilation on social media. Officials slapped together a gag order, and announced that ten social media users had been identified and referred to authorities for “spreading hate speech.” The usual platitudes about balancing security with freedom of expression\\xa0ensued, but there was silence on one important front.\\xa0 Jordan’s King Abdullah made no statement about, or gesture toward, this unprecedented incident until the fifth day after Nahed’s death - when the monarch finally paid a condolence visit to the journalist’s family in their hometown of Fuhays. Says a member of a prominent Jordanian political family that served the current king’s father: “King Hussein would have been there in 30 minutes.” So, why the long silence from the most important figure of authority in Jordan? The country is in the crosshairs of several of the most contentious political battles in the region’s recent history – and religious extremism has flourished in the vacuum created by Jordan’s inability to articulate a clear, strong direction for itself. “In terms of numbers, Jordan has the highest number of jihadists per capita fighting in Syria today than any other country,”\\xa0writes Osama Al Sharif in an op-ed in the Jordan Times.\\xa0 The former president of the Princess Sumaya University for Technology Dr. Hisham Ghassib, a longtime colleague of Nahed’s, says: “The Jordanian state criticizes these terrorists, this ideology, but at the same time it feeds it.” “Since 1975, the government has worked to Islamicize the academic curriculum in Jordan, when Ishak al-Farhan, a member of the Ikhwan, became minister of education,” Ghassib continues. “Look at the curricula. They insert verses of Koran and hadith in everything, even physics, mathematics - everything. And it is to a large extent Wahhabi in interpretation.” “The Ikhwan played a very negative role throughout the decades in this respect,” he adds. “(Current Al- Qaeda leader Ayman) al-Zawahiri was a member of the Ikhwan in Egypt. (ISIS chief Abu Bakr) al-Baghdadi was a member of the Ikhwan in Iraq. (Founding member of Al-Qaeda) Abdullah Azzam was one of the leaders of the Ikhwan in Jordan – and a faculty member at the University of Jordan!” It seems it can be a slippery slope from the “moderate” Ikhwan – which just last month re-joined the political process by securing 15 seats in the parliamentary elections – to “extreme” Salafism. These two themes – the influence of religion in the academic curriculum and the influence of conservative mosque imams on society – are repeated ad nauseam by Jordanians concerned about the environment that led to Nahed’s death. “We’re not against religion, but this is not the role of religion,” explains former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, now one of a handful of scholars and activists working toward developing more secular, diverse educational instruction. “The current curriculum doesn’t teach tolerance, acceptance of other points of view, it doesn’t teach critical thinking, doesn’t teach kids to question.” “We’re very worried about the textbooks. Changes are being driven by the security issue” Jordan now faces, and “after the murder (of Nahed Hattar), you are going to hear an even louder public opinion,” suggests Muasher. He directs me to two vocal fellow advocates who are meticulously investigating the content of the nation’s schoolbooks – both of whom have been directed to “stay at home” by authorities who are now taking death threats much more seriously. One of them is so worried; she refuses to meet with me. The other, an outspoken 35-year former ministry of education official, Dr. Thougan Obeidat - invited me to his home to discuss these issues. A year ago, Obeidat penned a controversial essay in Jordan’s Al Ghad newspaper called “ISIS in our textbooks.” “If ISIS ruled Jordan, they wouldn’t even need to change our textbooks,” declares Obeidat, who has written over 50 articles detailing the problems with the texts. In 2015, the schoolbooks “were pure ISIS culture,” excluding non-Muslims entirely, quoting from violent and lawless religious sayings, characterizing women in extremely subservient contexts. The efforts of Obeidat and others did result in small breakthroughs in the 2016 schoolbooks: a few pictures now portray women without hijab (in their homes, not outdoors), some now show men without beards. There are occasional mentions of churches – reflecting Jordan’s small religious diversity. There is discussion of “human values” - not “Islamic values” as before. Most lessons are still preceded by a Koranic verse in the new versions, but public outrage over the amendments have resulted in several public book burnings - at least two or three last week in the capital. I ask if the Muslim Brotherhood take a position on this issue. “The Ikhwan are not burning the books, but they are the provokers,” says Obeidat, who has received death threats and has also requested government protection. “The Ikhwan are moving everything in the environment, but they don’t appear as the face of it.” Nevertheless, Queen Rania has stepped forward to endorse the new academic initiatives, incremental though they may be. Muasher calls her recent speech on the subject “brave.” Obeidat is grateful for this royal show of support, but notes “the ministry of education, the Ikhwan got angry at her” for taking this stand. If you think Jordan’s academic curriculum is a minefield, wait till you hear about the country’s mosques.\\xa0 Business Insider characterizes\\xa0the problem thus: “The country has 4,500 preachers for its 6,300 mosques, including many who are not properly trained, creating a vacuum that has enabled extremist lay preachers to step in.”\\xa0 Just like part-time preacher Riad Abdallah, the Salafist gunman who took Nahed’s life. “Jordan’s decision makers don’t seem to understand that we are heading toward an explosion,” says Sunni cleric Dr. Mustafa Abu Rumman – a friend of Nahed’s since 2011 and his fellow activist against Islamic extremism. In mosques today, says the English-speaking preacher, “They pray for the mujahedeen in Iraq, Syria, Chechnya and Afghanistan. They criticize the Jews and Christians and wish their supporters harm.” Part of this is political, he claims. It comes from an “atmosphere” in Jordan since 2006 which turned against the ‘Resistance Axis’ – Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and (then) Hamas - in this region after the Israeli war on Lebanon: “Around one million Iraqi Shiite refugees were kicked out of Jordan then.” He rejects a common Jordanian view that social and economic disparities have caused this new intolerance. These may have played a “very small part” but “even the educated, well-off middle classes have joined Daesh (ISIS).” “A lot of our sons went to Saudi Arabia and studied there. They came back with this extreme education and ideology. In all our Sharia colleges in Jordan, they are from this idea. Now, 90 percent of our mosque imams are Wahhabi thinkers, influenced.”\\xa0 From religion to politics, Saudi Arabia feeling chill of isolation (Op-Edge by @snarwani) https://t.co/DawztS0rrKpic.twitter.com/ptIuUvT4u7 Abu Rumman has also received death threats. A Facebook campaign against him began, he says, after he visited Nahed’s family in the aftermath of the cartoon posting. He is also, at regular intervals, interrogated by the Mukhabarat (internal security service) over his views – which they sometimes think are too politically and religiously inclusive. “I raised the worshippers at my mosque based on moderation, love and humanity,” says Abu Rumman, who defended Nahed’s intentions vigorously when the public outcry over the cartoon first began. “I have, in my mosque, the 10 percent who were not Wahhabized. I used to hold joint Christian-Muslim activities at my mosque – some sponsored by the Awqaf Ministry.” But last month, that same ministry ejected him from his mosque and its accompanying housing. They had terminated his position in June, but he continued to give sermons and teach voluntarily. He tried to appeal the sudden dismissal, but says the minister himself said he “couldn’t do anything for me.” It is ironic that a learned, moderate Sunni cleric was removed from his pulpit, even as Nahed Hattar’s killer was preaching hate at another mosque in the same city. But it is symptomatic of the one-step-forward, two-steps-back approach of the Jordanian political establishment toward the radicalism that has permeated its every institution, whose tentacles reach into every strata of society – unchecked. Hossein Majali, Jordan’s former interior minister says “we are facing a crisis in the Islamic world” where there is “less understanding of the basis of our religion and the old boundaries do not stop us any longer.” “The easiest thing to do,” argues Majali “is to treat the symptom – to go to Deir Azzor and bomb ISIS. The hardest thing to do is to go to the production line. That production line is everywhere – in the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Afghanistan, so many places.” Majali suggests “hard measures” as a solution\\xa0– not just in schools and mosques, but especially in “social media, internet, media in its full spectrum.” He says government steps are in their “infancy. We’ve let it pass for a very long time and we’ve looked the other way.”\\xa0 That’s hard to swallow – or accept – when it was this very country, and this very king, who delivered the “Amman Message”\\xa0in 2004, to rally Islamic consensus around a unified, inclusive and tolerant vision for Islam.\\xa0 Jordan has veered so far from that path in the last dozen years, it is hard to imagine an initiative that has failed more dramatically. And it is difficult to conceive that the impotent institutions that allow extremism into their schools and places of worship - that have allowed thousands to train and march into jihad - could actually formulate a decisive plan to cull this virus. Especially since the infection is everywhere, even inside its decision making bodies. Nahed Hattar was sometimes cantankerous and difficult, single-minded and biting, but he forced Jordanians to confront their ills, with great courage and style. The diversity of his opinions lent his beloved country the color it lacked within its beige, monochromatic institutions – the kind of ideas that can move mountains, if only one has the clarity of vision to see the opportunity. Jordan is paralyzed, however. It has no vision, will or courage any longer. Decision makers tip toe around the edge of their own irrelevance. Nahed will be missed, even by Jordanians who don’t know he is gone, because Jordan is one shade duller. And they will be one step closer to the Salafist madness that has swept the Levant, because one more barrier has fallen against takfirism. Says his brother Majed: “These people live in the dark. They can’t even take the light of a candle – and Nahed was like the sun.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"So, this was Putin the peacemaker. Delivering a conciliatory news conference where everybody was a potential partner, even nefarious Western countries which imposed sanctions on Russia. The Russian President couldn’t have made his position more obvious if he’d turned up with flowers in his hair and released a flock of white doves while humming Beethoven’s Ode To Joy. There are three likely reasons for his sudden reticence. First, a feeling that Russia’s Syria policy has largely succeeded. Also, how domestic economic concerns, facing a possible 2018 re-election campaign, need to be addressed after some years when foreign policy was a priority. And thirdly a willingness to give Donald Trump time to show whether his campaign rhetoric about building a new relationship with Russia is actually implemented when in office. There’s also the issue where some of Trump’s cabinet picks are favorable from Moscow's viewpoint. Notably, the choice for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Thus, it’s reasonable to suggest that Putin would be wary of saying or doing anything which might jeopardize the ExxonMobil chairman’s chances of winning Congressional approval. As a result, this 2016 installment of the president’s annual marathon press event was light on geopolitics. Unlike previous years, the world order, neither new or current, received little mention and the star of the show was more interested in cracking jokes than lambasting anyone. Clocking in at around four hours, Putin answered questions from a wide range of journalists. Of course, we had some fawning admirers, a few literally shaking with excitement at being chosen. But, on the other hand, there were also posers from liberal Russian opposition reporters and a Ukrainian was given a chance to grill the president. On top of this, some Western outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal, BBC, and NBC were also handed the microphone. Detractors of the format wail about the lack of follow up questions and a few dismiss the exercise as a ‘stunt.’ Nevertheless, even Putin’s biggest critics would surely admit that regarding mastery of his brief and the ability to authoritatively speak on so many topics, without an autocue, the Russian leader’s performance is remarkable. It’s also very doubtful if any other major world leaders could pull off a similar presentation. From a domestic perspective, and after all the news conference is primarily aimed at Russian voters, Putin had relatively good news on the economy. He forecast how the country’s GDP is only expected to contract by 0.5 percent this year “thanks to growth in the real sector of the economy.” This follows a 2015 shrinkage of 3.7 percent. While the recession has largely been caused by falling energy prices, the Kremlin has made efforts to diversify the economy. “We exported $14 billion of weapons, $7 billion in IT services and we have pockets of expertise. In aviation and defense, we are world leaders.” The president also spoke of an agricultural revival. Under his watch, Russia has flipped from being a net grain importer to becoming the planet’s biggest exporter of the foodstuff. Speaking of oil, Putin maintained how his government expects a $40 a barrel price for the black gold in 2017. However, all experts in the sector project $50 and plus. That would mean an extra $21 billion for state coffers next year, significantly reducing the budget deficit. Although Putin’s current term runs to 2018, The Wall Street Journal wanted to know if we can expect an early election. The president’s quip, “in which country,” masked speculation in the ‘expert community’ about a snap poll. Later, Putin insisted how he mightn’t even seek another term. “Time will tell, I'll decide based on the state of the country and the world, and what we’ve done and what I can do at that stage,” he replied. There was a very deliberate nod to Trump when he said: “Russia is stronger than any potential aggressor in the world today.” In Putin speak, this translates as ‘Moscow no longer sees America as a potential enemy.’ Because he recently admitted and repeated here, that the US is the world’s most powerful military player. However, he sounded a note of caution on nuclear proliferation and a potential new arms race. While the statement “we have overhauled our nuclear missiles, have new nuclear submarines, new airbases, and improved aircraft, but in full compliance with the START treaties” sounds menacing out of context, it is somewhat different in another light. “In 2001 (it was actually 2002), the US pulled out of the ABM (anti-ballistic missile treaty). This was the cornerstone of European security. We said we’d respond.” Hence, Putin appeared to be opening the door for new arms control agreements with Washington. Regarding US internal affairs and the repeated claims of Russian interference in the recent election there, Putin scoffed at the allegations. “They are attempts by the Democrats and the current administration to blame their failures on external factors. The Democrats didn't just lose the presidential election, but the House and the Senate as well. Did I do that as well? They need to learn to lose with dignity,” he jibed. He also reached out to Republican voters and moderate Democrats saying “the vast majority of the US population have the same ideas of threats and challenges and share our traditional values.” On the first meeting with Trump: We will discuss how to put Russia-US relations back on track Two years ago, Ukraine was the main topic here. This year, the tone had also mellowed. He called for the normalization of relations with Kiev: “We have come a long way since the summer of 2014.” Lashing out at the “cold war” visa system in Europe, which isn’t based on GDP but rather on “values,” he praised Brussels’ apparent offer of open access to Ukrainians, which surprised some on social media. “I fully support the EU's decision to allow visa-free travel for Ukrainians,” Putin remarked. Yet, it didn't placate a Ukrainian reporter present who asked: “You do realize that even if one day you leave office, Russians will stay occupiers for Ukrainians?” Putin shot back, “If the Ukrainian army wasn't considered as the occupant in their own country in the Donbass that would change the situation.” Other talking points included when the President insinuated how Ankara may have problems inside its state services, “I'm no longer so skeptical that SU-24 (the Russian jet shot down by Turkey in 2015) wasn't shot by a rogue pilot too.”\\xa0 And when he asked his Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, to find someone from “TV channel RT, which is accused of all sorts of cardinal sins.” He also observed how “what we have between Russia and China is more than just a strategic partnership.” And that first meeting with Trump? “The newly elected president needs time to build his team, it's not expedient to meet unless ready,” Putin cautioned. Nevertheless, their initial encounter will certainly be one of the news events of 2017.

A spokeswoman for the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which asked Cameron in March if he would appear before the end of April, told the Press Association the panel would now press ahead with publication of its report into the war. Prime ministers traditionally refuse to attend Commons Select Committee meetings, leaving them to governmental department heads instead. US President Barack Obama recently claimed the PM had appeared “distracted” during the Libyan war, though the Atlantic magazine reported in March that Obama privately refers to the war as a “sh*t-show” of Cameron’s making. Recent rumors that the UK could intervene in Libya again with a commitment of 1,000 troops have died down after widespread criticism. Libya’s new UN-brokered unity government rejected the idea of accepting UK troops almost immediately upon arrival in the war-ravaged capital of Tripoli in mid-April. The new authority apparently felt it would look like a Western lackey if its power obviously derived from foreign military support. Mattia Toaldo, a Libya specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Times newspaper at the time that officials in the new administration are afraid of being seen as “foreign puppets” and hope “people in Europe will stop talking about this for a few weeks.” Tory MP Crispin Blunt, chairman of the UK Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, has been an outspoken critic of both the original war and calls for further intervention. On April 14, he rebuked the government for being “less than candid” about current UK Special Forces activity in Libya, saying it should come clean about its clandestine operations. '],\n",

The Turkish leader noted that the nation’s defense industry has become increasingly independent from foreign suppliers and technology producers. He asserted that Turkey’s “strategic geographical location” does not allow it to waste time when it comes to developing its domestic defense industry. Once completed, TCG Anadolu will be Turkish Navy’s largest and most expensive warship. Her key features have not been disclosed in full, but Spanish Navy’s Juan Carlos I, a warship of a similar class, is capable of carrying an air wing of up to 10 F-35s, around 900 troops, helicopters and armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). NATO member Turkey has long harbored the ambition to become a leading naval power in the Middle East and beyond, particularly in areas that once were parts of the Ottoman Empire.

              "  'The revamped version of what was previously known as the J-31 made its debut flight in the northeastern city of Shenyang on Friday, the state-owned\\xa0China Daily reported. The trailblazing aircraft is the brainchild of Shenyang Aircraft Corp, part of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). According to AVIC, the FC-31 has a maximum take-off weight of 28 metric tons, a flight radius of 1,250km, and a top speed of Mach 1.8 (or 1.8 times the speed of sound.) The aircraft can easily carry 8 tons of weapons, holding six missiles in its internal weapons bay, plus another six under its wings. Sergey Kornev, head of Russia’s Air Force Equipment Export Department, earlier told RIA Novosti the J-31 will fly on Russian aircraft engines RD-93. A publicity officer at AVIC, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the flight test to the China Daily. The FC-31 first came under the spotlight in 2012 when the first prototype managed to stay airborne for as long as 11 minutes during a test. The new fighter boasts a number of improvements over the previous one, experts say.\\xa0 “Compared with the first FC-31, there are a lot of improvements on the second prototype. Changes were made to the airframe, wings and vertical tails, which make it leaner, lighter and more maneuverable,” Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing, told the newspaper. Another aircraft expert told the China Daily that the new FC-31 has been equipped with an electro-optical targeting system and helmet-mounted display. According to Fu Qianshao, the next challenge for AVIC is to use the FC-31 to capture market share at home and overseas. “I believe the aircraft will have bright prospects in the market. Based on my experience and knowledge, I presume its price will be around $70 million, about half that of the United States’ Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,” Fu said. “Moreover, the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighter jets are priced at about $100 million. All of these mean you can spend a lot less money to get an advanced, fifth-generation stealth combat plane,” he added. The deputy general manager of AVIC, Li Yuhai, previously told the newspaper that the company wants the FC-31 to help “put an end to some nations’ monopolies on the fifth-generation fighter jet” and this plane “is able to compete with any other aircraft of its kind.” The only fifth-generation fighter jet currently available on the market is the US Lockheed Martin\\xa0F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine combat aircraft designed to perform ground attack and air defense missions. According to Lockheed Martin, it’s the “world’s most advanced” multi-role fighter, boasting “unmatched capabilities” to military forces around the world. '],\n",

              "  'The Russian\\xa0report is based on the investigation carried out by a team of bloggers, journalists, aviation experts and volunteers calling themselves ‘Anti-Bellingcat’. It makes use of the technical expertise of the Russian arms producer Almaz-Antey. The leader of the group and author of the report is Yury Kotenok, editor-in-chief of the news website Segodnia.ru. The biggest challenge for them is to help shed light on the absolute truth behind the tragedy. Their primary objective is to cut short the continuous spread of disinformation regarding the MH17 international investigation.\\xa0 According to the authors of the Russian report, published on Tuesday, Bellingcat is “ready to design any version whatsoever meant to accuse Russia.\" “That’s an information war,” Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the chief designer of Almaz-Antey, said in an interview with the\\xa0Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “[Bellingcat’s] version [of the tragedy] is evidence-free. They do not build a version based on facts, but trim the facts to fit their version. Just to give an example, the Dutch, at the suggestion of Bellingcat, claim that the missile flew toward the plane. This has been refuted by all our data, both mathematical and experimental,” he noted on Friday. The first discrepancy, noted by the Russian activists that Bellingcat\\xa0was trying to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a BUK missile system belonging to the Russian army.\\xa0 As “proof” Bellingcat referred to a Paris Match photo in July 2014 in Ukraine allegedly showing a BUK missile system being transported near Donetsk. The British outlet compared it with a picture of a BUK on the way inside Russia in Belgorod Region, alleging they are one and the same. However, in their report, Russian activists note a\\xa0key difference\\xa0between the two. The BUK pictured in Russia contains a \"step\"\\xa0on the left side of the system. It has been introduced only after 1984 to ease the crew’s embarking to the vehicle.\\xa0The picture posted by Paris Match and cited by Bellingcat does not have that feature,the activists note. “This means only one thing – the photographs presented different modifications of the ‘BUK’ systems, so, as sad as it might be for Bellingcat, there is no way it can be one and the same vehicle,”\\xa0the report states. In the report Russian activists have countered Bellingcat’s claims that there have been no Ukrainian BUK missile systems in the conflict-zone in the country’s East. They provided various screen shots of Ukrainian media reports, picturing BUK missile systems of the Ukrainian army in the conflict area. One of the screenshots contains part of the program called “Hour CH” by the Ukrainian First National TV channel. The respective program is dated July 16, just a day before the MH17 crash. “The photo shows a self-propelled fire installation \"Buk\" [missile system] and radar 19ZH6 (35D6). This radar station in the Ukrainian army is used as an additional means of controlling the air space and targeting systems for air defense fire units, armed with ‘Buk’ [missile system]”, the activists’ investigation finds. Ukraine\\xa0“does possess BUK missile systems of type BUK M1”\\xa0and Kiev has in fact confirmed the modernization of some of it, adviser to the head designer of the Russian Almaz Antey arms producer, which also manufactures BUK systems, Mikhail Malyshevsky, told RT. Last Wednesday, Russian media obtained a statement by Almaz-Antey, in which the company accused Western media, including Bellingcat, of trying to manipulate public opinion and confusing facts to discredit its own investigation into the issue. Russian activists have also raised questions over Bellingcat’s allegation that the location from where the plane has been shot down by BUK was under rebel control. Bellingcat backs up its claims by showing maps of the conflict region provided by the Ukrainian military as well as services like LiveUAmap и kot-ivanov. But in fact Bellingcat itself admits that the official maps “did not reflect the full picture” of the fighting, according to Russian activists’ report. LiveUAmap has also a problem of being rather not accurate, showing some of the fighting “deep inside Russian territory,” the document adds. Russian bloggers accused Bellingcat of simply “interpreting facts” to suit their theory. “Even an approximate study of the evidences which are imposed by Bellingcat as irrefutable, allow us to make a conclusion about their\\xa0untenability,”\\xa0the report says.\\xa0 Speaking to RT, the former deputy chief of the Russian Air Defense forces, Aleksandr Tazehulalov, said the Malaysian Boeing might have been shot down unintentionally. “Many are inclined to believe that given the severe condition of the Ukrainian army at that time, the preparation of the crews of anti-missile systems was not enough for their effective use. I cannot confirm this theory … but every crew can make a mistake, there is this notorious human factor. I do not exclude it,” he said. Ukraine has been already involved in a civilian passenger jet being brought down by a missile over its territory. On October 4, 2001 a Russian TU 154 liner was shot down by a Ukrainian S-200 missile during drills in the Black Sea, killing all 78 people onboard. Back then Kiev officially recognized the responsibility and issued an apology. On September 28, the Dutch-led Joint Investigative committee will release its findings on the criminal part of the investigation, which is expected to name the exact responsible side for the crash. Malaysian Boeing MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed over war-ravaged East Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people onboard. '],\n",

In all, 335 politicians were present at the meeting in the Luxembourg Palace. The motion is non-binding, however. The initiatives of deputies and senators, aimed at pressuring the government, have “no binding force because the renewal of the embargo is made in Brussels and requires unanimity of the 28 Member States,”\\xa0Le Figaro reported. In late April, 55 members of the French National Assembly supported a similar resolution, submitted by 85 French MPs calling on the government not to extend EU-imposed sanctions on Russia. The debate on canceling sanctions was held at the National Assembly for the first time. Thierry Mariani, a member of the center-right Republicans party, who initiated the parliamentary debate, said anti-Russian sanctions should be lifted because they only cause harm. \"We are demanding that the sanctions be lifted because they are totally ineffective and they are dangerous for our economy,\" he told the Assembly. \"I have seen our minister of agriculture standing in front of our farmers and say \\'We have to lift the sanctions.\\' I\\'ve seen the minister of finance reiterate the same thing. And all they do is say \\'We can\\'t do anything, Europe is to blame\\',\" the MP told RT in April. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last week that a number of EU states are reluctant to extend anti-Russian sanctions. The big question is whether the 28-nation bloc will nonetheless decide to renew them after they expire on July 31. \"The sanctions are there to ensure a political solution,” Steinmeier told reporters last Tuesday. “I don\\'t know what the European Council will decide on Russia sanctions,\" he said, adding that the recent release of Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko from jail would hopefully \"bring a new dynamic into the talks between Russia and Ukraine.\" A number of prominent European policymakers and businesses have emphasized that sanctions have proven pointless and economically damaging for all parties. Italy and Hungary said last month there could be no automatic extension of EU sanctions against Russia, Reuters reported. In mid-May, the council of Italy\\'s Veneto region adopted a resolution calling for the country\\'s government to work toward lifting sanctions against Russia. Twenty-nine out of 51 members of the regional council voted in favor of the resolution, while nine voted against, Interfax reported. Italian lawmaker Stefano Valdegamberi told Sputnik that in just one year the Veneto region lost over €600 million ($679.8 million) due to the slump in exports to Russia. Some, in contrast, have been calling on Brussels not to relax sanctions on Moscow until the Minsk peace agreement is fully implemented. Poland\\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski has recently warned that lifting sanctions would weaken the bloc\\'s position vis-à-vis Russia. \"The European Union\\'s authority ... in the future depends on the successful influencing of Russia through sanctions,\" Szymanski told Reuters last week. Since 2014, EU and US sanctions against Russia have targeted Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors, along with a number of government officials, businessmen and public figures. Moscow responded by imposing an embargo on agricultural produce, food and raw materials against countries that joined anti-Russian sanctions. Both sides have since repeatedly broadened and extended the sanctions. '],\n",

CAGE suggests public relations firm Breakthrough Media is tasked with spinning these counter-narratives and is likely protected under Britain’s Official Secrets Act (OSA). The advocacy group says the use of this legislation to cloak a government propaganda project in secrecy is a grievous abuse of government power. **Exclusive**CAGE reveals groups involved in covert Government propaganda programmehttps://t.co/KBr2e6MaqRpic.twitter.com/LSAIVi3i2i CAGE insists it would never disclose data that could undercut Britain’s national security. However, it says the Home Office’s clandestine propaganda project – run by the Research, Information and Communications Unit (RICU) – abandons democratic debate and due process in favor of state secrecy. CAGE argues the root causes of “politically motivated violence and radicalization” cannot be uncovered by a securitized government response and the Home Office must embark on broader ideological terrain in order to tackle these issues. Ben Hayes, who co-authored CAGE’s report, said the government’s secret propaganda project is damaging to society. “We should be under no illusion as to what is going on here. When the government starts using community groups and NGOs to disseminate government propaganda to hoodwink the public into believing they are authentic ‘grassroots’ campaigns, it damages everyone in civil society,” he said. “Democracy requires clear lines between the security state and the police on the one hand, and civil society, public and social services on the other.” UK government \\'running covert counter-extremism propaganda campaign\\' https://t.co/qymlmHAzrUpic.twitter.com/s0ZKytI716 Hayes called for honesty with respect to state-sponsored propaganda projects. “Having railed against ‘sock-puppet’ NGOs and introduced a ban on charities in receipt of public money lobbying government, it is time for an honest conversation about the impact, legitimacy and effectiveness of the government’s own secret propaganda programs,” he said. CAGE Research Director Asim Qureshi, who also co-authored the report, said RICU is using so-called grassroots organizations as convenient government mouthpieces. “There is also evidence to suggest that the government is using the Official Secrets Act to hide its relationship with the role of Breakthrough Media, the PR company driving the propaganda. This suggests an abuse of power and a contempt for open society,” he said. “The findings of this report should be a cause of concern to the British public. It confirms the hidden hand of those who wish to manufacture consent for the expansion of the security state.” RT asked the Home Office whether it could confirm or deny the existence of the RICU propaganda project referenced throughout the report.\\xa0 A spokesperson for the government body defended RICU, praising the support the group has given to government actors\\xa0“working on the frontline” to combat\\xa0the “warped ideologies” of extremism and terrorism. \"This work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard to reach audiences and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare,” the spokesperson said. “We respect the bravery of individuals and organizations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support, empower and protect them.” Extremely worrying that covert government elements infiltrating uni campuses https://t.co/guhbnsnG6N#Prevent#RICUhttps://t.co/u5rAmIQnMD The Home Office spokesperson said the government body is as transparent as it can be about RICU’s operating model, but failed to make any mention of whether the organization is covered by the Official Secrets Act (OFA). \"Our guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do,” the spokesperson said. “At the same time we are as open as possible about RICU’s operating model, and have referenced the role of RICU in a number of publications and in Parliament.” '],\n",

              "  'Paul Fletcher has developed new football stadiums for clubs across England and believes that the London stadium – which was purpose-built for the 2012 Olympic Games – needs dramatic modifications in order to cater for football fans. “Either we go on as we are for the next 30 or 40 years or we knock [London Stadium] down and start again,” Fletcher told the BBC. \"Something has to give. If you want to satisfy spectators the only way to get those spectators near that pitch is to knock it down and start again,\" added the former Burnley FC striker, who is now an executive. Fletcher said the ground should have been built for the long-term purpose of hosting football matches but be able to host athletics events for the necessary time. \"When I build my football stadiums, my number one concern is the spectator. What they\\'ve done is tried to convert an athletics stadium into a football pitch and, in my opinion, it doesn\\'t work,” Fletcher said. \"The building was almost built when they started to talk to West Ham.” \"I said what you must do is design a football stadium that converts to an athletics stadium for two weeks of its lifetime,\" he added. West Ham won the bid to move into the London Stadium in Stratford from the Boleyn Ground at Upton Park in December 2012; the decision was controversial. London Stadium hit headlines last week when the EFL Cup game against West Ham and Chelsea erupted into violence inside and outside the ground, with helpless stewards and police citing the vastness of the venue as a contributing factor to the unrest. The East London club subsequently banned 200 individuals for offenses including abusive language and missile throwing and Metropolitan Police arrested seven individuals. But the violence during and after the match versus Chelsea wasn’t the first time there has been disorder in and around the ground.

The president also praised United Russia as the main consolidating force in Russian society. “It is largely [thanks] to your effort that Russian society has reached an agreement on strategic development issues. This agreement has allowed us to realize deep transformations in the economic and social spheres, to launch national priority projects and a large-scale demographic program,” Putin said. He backed up his points by comparing the current situation with the dire state of events at the time United Russia was founded in the early 2000s. “You know and remember well what state our country was in back then. It was under threat of break-up, it was like a patchwork from the legal and political perspective and the North Caucasus was literally overwhelmed by anti-Russian terrorist aggression,” Putin said. “A significant part of the economy and some important state institutions fell under the control of oligarchs or, to put it simply, criminal structures,” he added. “You had to change the situation, reinforce the Constitution and in essence, restore the state’s capability and unity, overcome the split in society itself,” Putin told the United Russia convention.

              "  'The humiliating January 12 incident took place when Iranian navy intercepted two American ships off Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. The US vessels, that according to the Pentagon were on their way from Kuwait to the US naval base in Bahrain, experienced mechanical problems and drifted into Iranian waters where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) detained everyone onboard.  Footage of nine men and one woman in Iranian custody made world headlines, forcing US Secretary of State John Kerry to use his diplomatic channels to secure the release of US servicemen just hours later. The incident, however, increased the confrontation level between the two navies in the region. On Sunday, adding fuel to the fire, Commander of the IRGC, Second Naval Zone General Ali Razmjou told reporters that “thousands” of valuable documents were seized from the US sailors at the time of their brief detention. “We seized thousands of pages of valuable intelligence from the US marines during their detention,” said General Razmjou in the Bushehr province on Sunday, FARS reports.\\xa0 The General did not disclose the type of information or content of the intercepted files, but Razmjou’s claim seems to support the US Navy report in June that found that some US seamen captured by the Iranians might have shared sensitive information with their captors that included information on the capabilities of their vessels. “It is clear that some, if not all, crew members provided at least some information to interrogators beyond name, rank, service number and date of birth,” the report\\xa0said.\\xa0 While interactions between Iranian and US ships are common, American officials have raised growing alarm recently about the risk of an escalation at sea between the two states. Yet at the same time, Washington keeps on provoking the Islamic Republic by flying or sailing in close proximity to Iran’s borders. While Tehran maintains that the US and its allies violate the country’s sovereignty, US continues to insist that Iran is harassing its warships in the region. According to reports, there have been more than 30 close encounters with Iranian vessels by American ships so far this year. Last Wednesday, Lieutenant Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy General Alireza Tangsiri said that Iran’s navy intercepted and detained a number of ships over the past year. “The IRGC Navy has detained American and British trespassers twice and the Canadians and Australians once in the Persian Gulf,” Tangsiri told reporters. In relevant remarks made by Tangsiri in July, the general said that US warships and their allies have been warned to stay out Iran’s territorial waters. “We have a strong presence in the quintuple regions of the South and our independent bases in the Sea of Oman, in such a way that foreign vessels never dare to approach regions 12 miles away from our territorial waters and if they do, they will be treated like what we did to the Americans (on January 12),” Tangsiri said in July.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"The UK has conducted a public inquiry\\xa0into the death of the former Russian FSB officer Aleksandr Litvinenko. According to the report, Vladimir Putin and his administration ‘probably’ had motive to murder Litvinenko. British judge Robert Owen, who was leading the inquiry, claimed the poisoning of Litvinenko by former KGB members Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun was a part of the operation of the Federal Security Service (FSB.) Litvinenko died in a London hospital from polonium poisoning in 2006. “This man was killed, was murdered in London almost 10 years ago. This latest report was set up in July 2014 – interestingly, just a couple of weeks after the MH17 disaster. So it was set up in this particular climate, this anti-Russia climate, and it has gone on now for 18 months. And what have they come up with - they’ve come up with a verdict that ‘probably’ this was the work of the Kremlin. “Probably” - is not evidence,” Journalist and broadcaster Neil Clark told RT. “What is lacking – is any hard evidence, this is just conjecture; this is just a theory put forward; one of the theories is that the Kremlin was behind this. But there are other theories too to explain why this man may have been murdered,” he said. “We’ve got to look at the context of this. The fact was this man died in 2006, and we’ve got an inquiry set up in 2014 in the very month when the West was taking very anti-Russian line.” “…If to look at the bigger picture, in 2006 relations between Britain and Russia were improving. So what logic would there have been in the Kremlin ordering this murder in a very public place in London? It doesn’t really make sense, does it? If you think about it from the Russian point of view, this man is a minor figure; he wasn’t as if he was going to stand for president and pose a real threat to Putin. The risk would have been very high and that is what makes me skeptical of the fact that the Kremlin was behind this, and there are other theories to explain this man’s murder,” Clark added. The UK report on the causes of Litvinenko’s death doesn’t have any supportive evidence, and is partly based on statements fabricated by figures like Berezovsky, said William Dunkerley, author of “The Phony Murder.” RT:\\xa0Is the public inquiry really that public? And how different is it from a regular trial? William Dunkerley: First of all it is not a trail at all, this isn’t a judicial procedure, it is a public inquiry. The term ‘public inquiry’ is actually a misnomer, because the rules in the UK allow a public inquiry to be conducted behind closed doors. RT:\\xa0The coroner's inquest into Litvinenko's death was suspended in July 2014 to start a public inquiry shortly after. What can you say about this timing? WD: The timing is interesting, the coroner’s inquest sort of came to an end when the Home Secretary told the coroner to stop conducting an illicit criminal investigation. The coroner is supposed to concentrate on judging the cause of death. Sir Robert [Owen] was not doing that, he wasn’t doing his job. The Home Secretary finally reined him in, told them to concentrate on his statutory duties and asked him to not go off on a witch-hunt for Russian culpability in the case. Then, things changed when Prime Minister [David] Cameron got involved. He put the whole issue back on the table, and turned [Sir Robert] Owen, now chairman of the public inquiry, loose on his search for Russian state culpability. And this coincidently happened on the day that the EU announced additional sanctions against Russia, in a sort of part of the sanctions frenzy that the public inquiry was opened. RT:\\xa0It's been almost a decade since he died, why is the UK launching an investigation now? WD: The story was really confounded by misleading information right from the beginning. One of Putin’s political adversaries Boris Berezovsky, who was a fugitive oligarch hanging out or hiding out in London, made a lot of fabricated statements about the Litvinenko case, that incriminated the Russian state and in particular President Putin. RT:\\xa0Isn’t the fact that that the inquiry was held behind the closed doors make the investigation more complicated? WD: Yes, it is a complication in the investigation that the public inquiry was able to hold hearings behind closed doors. Most of the media reports gave the impression that the public inquiries going to add transparency to the case, but actually the opposite was true. RT:\\xa0Are we seeing the increase of strain in UK-Russia relations? WD: Well, the UK- Russia relations have sort of been up and down throughout the course of this whole thing. At one point the Berezovsky people, Mrs. Litvinenko and others were critical of the UK for not coming to a conclusion about this that would agree with their version of the case. They said that the UK was avoiding doing that, because it didn’t want to offend Russia, in order to preserve relations between the two countries. Now some people theorize that since the UK- Russia relationship is so bad that it doesn’t matter if there is offence given by the report from the public inquiry… …. People are conditioned to believe in the story that has been going on in the news. It is not based on facts and there have not been supportive evidence, but people have been exposed to this story for a long, long time now. The truth that I’ve found in my research is counterintuitive to people who have been following all of the Western news reports. Martin McCauley, former senior lecturer at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London on latest Litvinenko inquiry: “ All they can do, as they said, “we have a prima facie case which proves that Lugovoy and Kovtun were acting as part of the FSB,” which goes right up to Nikolai Patrushev. But prima facie only means on the face of it. Therefore, the case is not proven. In other words it is a probability, and in an English court it wouldn’t stand up, because you couldn’t convict Lugovoy and Kovtun on the evidence, which has been presented in the report… They didn’t cross-examine or interview Lugovoy or Kovtun…” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"],\n",

He added that “this administration, the United States government takes all measures during the targeting process to avoid or minimalizing civilian casualties.” SANA said that a\\xa0“massacre” occurred in the village of al-Ghandoura and “on the heels of this appalling crime, ISIS brutally murdered 24 civilians from the locals of al-Bweir village,” which is also located near Manjib. “The ministry cited striking similarities between the massacres committed by the US-led Coalition and the terrorist organizations in an attempt to exacerbate the situation across Syria following the Syrian army’s recent wins in Aleppo city,” continued the letter to the UN quoted by the agency.

Detroit-based journalist Abayomi Azikiwe, an editor at Pan-African News Wire, told RT that a lack of cooperation between the US government and that of President Bashar Assad, whose exit Washington considers “a prerequisite” for peace, may be the main reason American airstrikes are claiming civilian lives en masse.\\xa0 “As long as they continue to not work with the Syrian government we are going to continue to see more of these attacks resulting in civilian casualties,” Azikiwe said, pointing out that Syria “never invited the United States to bomb any of its territory.” Azikiwe noted that, while Washington admits it inflicts casualties and pledges to look into cases of civilian deaths, the US military is reluctant to prosecute its own officers and commanders, who bear responsibility for ordering strikes.

The experiments in revolutions are being made in many nations, even in their natural partners such as the countries of the European Union,” Sergey Naryshkin wrote in the article published on Friday in the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “It seems that the transatlantic plans to achieve absolute domination have transformed into an unhealthy maniacal idea,” he noted. READ MORE: PACE monitors not expected at State Duma elections – top Russian MP Naryshkin also wrote that in order to achieve this domination, the United States was skillfully using modern information technology in the propaganda field without any respect towards the sovereignty of independent nations or the principle of non-interference into their internal affairs. “There are no morals or respect for international law in this situation. We cannot describe it as democracy,” he wrote. The speaker went on to state the necessity of breaking the artificial connection between the internal politics of European nations and the processes developing in the international politics. “While accepting the evident fact of ongoing globalization, sovereign nations must seek some constants in their economic and political systems that would guarantee their future from the influence of destructive mechanisms launched from the outside,” Naryshkin stated. He then gave an example of such mechanism saying that the so-called “transatlantic forces” were aggressively imposing their will on European organizations and this resulted in the situation in which European groups distance from their original goals, lose their sovereignty and get staffed by people who are dependent from the “transatlantic forces.”“The most vivid example of such organization is the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Only a key reform of this structure can put it back on the way of normal development and prevent it from becoming a completely marginal site,” Naryshkin wrote, noting also that the full restoration of the Russian delegation’s rights in PACE could be the first indicator of improvement. The Duma chief stated that Russia is inclined towards constructive dialogue with its European partners and the United States, but only on condition that this will be a dialogue of equals. He also emphasized that Russia was against the movements promoting disintegration in Europe as such process carried a lot of regional risks. “We are interested in greater stability of our partners, both as national states and as unions of such states.” Russia’s relations with PACE soured in April 2014 after the assembly approved an anti-Russian resolution on the political crisis in Ukraine. PACE also deprived the Russian delegation of the right to vote and banned it from participating in the group’s ruling bodies and monitoring missions. Russian lawmakers responded with a resolution stating that nations that have repeatedly violated international law and caused thousands of casualties have no moral right to judge Russia or impose sanctions on it. After the scandal, Russian delegation members left PACE because they considered it impossible to resume discussions while sanctions were still in force.

Brad Cabana: My immediate thought is that’s a continuation of the previous defensive position of the Clinton campaign to essentially blame Russia – cast doubts in the minds of the American public... Unfortunately for them, on this side of the pond it’s been quite evident that those emails came from an investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s right-hand woman’s ex-husband. That casts doubt on the previous commentary they were making about the Russians being involved with the WikiLeaks.

However, I think the Russian angle – I don’t hear anybody on the ground that were really listening to that in any seriousness. RT:\\xa0Is it a distraction technic at the end of the day here?\\xa0 BC: It is a deflection to cause the American people to focus on the Russian angle as opposed to the content of the e-mails, quite frankly. However, like I say, this latest blame-game is really going to damage the original propaganda if you will, that was being used against WikiLeaks in the beginning. So it may actually backfire on the Clinton campaign.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0What is the general feeling amongst the public? Are people jumping up and down by the content of the emails? BC: I think there is a great thirst for that information. Mrs. Clinton has a terrible trust rating with the American people, to begin with. So this won’t help her. On the flip side, her accusations against Mr. Trump – that he will somehow be dangerous in international affairs, kind of slips away when you consider the fact she’s using Russia, a world power, to plant a political attack on her.

He then passes the gun to his accomplice, who shoots a man in a white shirt and a boy crossing the road. The images were shared by the Metropolitan Police’s gang violence force Trident in the hope someone can identify the suspects. \"We are keen for the public to give us any information in relation to this appeal, who witnessed the incident or who recognizes the suspects”, said Trident investigator Detective Constable Jo Ross. “It happened in broad daylight and in an area full of schoolchildren.\" The victims were identified as a 21-year-old man who was shot through his chest, leading to a punctured lung and windpipe, and a 16-year-old who suffered minor injuries. The older man was taken to a local hospital and received immediate surgery. He was said to have made a full recovery. The schoolboy, who is believed to have been on his way to the library when he was shot, was taken to a hospital with a wound to his arm but was later discharged. “The 21-year-old victim was fortunate to recover from what were potentially life-threatening injuries at the time of the incident. Other passersby were threatened by having a shotgun pointed at them – these are dangerous people,” Ross added. After the shooting the men fled the scene, covering their faces with hoodies and bandanas. The man still carrying the shotgun grabbed an unlocked bicycle and rode off, with his friends trailing behind. The three were also found in further CCTV images in which the shooter threatened further passersby with his gun. Both bystanders were mere feet away from the criminal. The thugs were all said to be black men in their 20s, one of whom was wearing a dark hoodie with a large Franklin and Marshall logo, a fur-lined hat and a gray bandana. '],\n",

HRW also oversees an international treaty banning cluster munitions. \"Human Rights Watch viewed photographs taken on January 6 in Sanaa that showed unmistakable remnants of cluster munitions, including unexploded submunitions,\" HRW added. The nearest \"small\" military targets including an office and a garage used by military guards, at which the strikes might have been directed, were hundreds of meters from the populated areas that were hit. \"The use of cluster munitions meant they [the attacks] were still unlawful,\" the organization said. The human rights advocacy group identified the munitions \"as US-made BLU-63 antipersonnel/anti-material submunitions and components of a CBU-58 cluster bomb.\" It added that parts of the bomb remnants had markings indicating that it was manufactured in the US in 1978. According to US export records obtained by HRW, Washington transferred 1,000 such bombs to Saudi Arabia sometime between 1970 and 1995. \"The US is a party to the armed conflict in Yemen, playing a direct role in coordinating military operations, and as such, is obligated to investigate alleged violations of the laws of war in which its forces took part,\" HRW said in its report, adding that an independent, international inquiry into the alleged violations should be set up by the UN Human Rights Council. \"It may have been 20 years since the US last provided cluster munitions to the Saudis, but they are being used to kill civilians now,\" Goose said, adding that if the US fails to prevent any further use of such munitions by the coalition, it risks \"becoming complicit in their use.\" Nearly 2,800 civilians have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, the UN said earlier this week.

Originally entitled ‘The Dongald’, the street artist made amendments by painting what appears to be Clinton’s face on to a part of Trump’s body. “Had to censor The Dongald, don\\'t know if I just made it more offensive or not?” Lushsux wrote on social media. Meanwhile, he told RT that he believes there was less fuss made about the Trump mural because of public opinion being largely against the Republican candidate. “It is counter to their narrative and it’s not something they find offensive,” Lushsux explained to RT. “They find that funny whereas someone on the other side of the political spectrum would say find Hillary funny and would find Donald Trump a bit rude,” he concluded. A photo posted by lushsux (@lushsux) on Jul 29, 2016 at 7:06am PDT Plenty of social media users gave their backing to Lushsux across various platforms.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma-challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard-waving, holler-whooping people bused in from every town in the country. Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process. Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years. It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next. A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more. For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame. This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy-eyed patriot boasts. In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous. In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought. At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was “Lock her up! Lock her up!” with all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman’s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house. Trump promises to “Make America Great Again,” a sufficiently open-ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean. Given the billionaire’s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president. But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and is less than enthusiastic about NATO. This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm. Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin. She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, the gloating over the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America’s way be described as progressive. Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have some\\xa0interesting friends and supporters - Wall Street and George Soros prime among them – who aren’t exactly struggling to get by. Then, too, the sympathy she’s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill’s notorious crime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities. This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end. It is a two-term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question. How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years? LIVE on #Periscope: Watch Donald Trump speak at #RNCinCLEhttps://t.co/4u91jEcVo7 The question answers itself, as it does when applied to every US president and administration since the end of the Second World War, condemning each and every one with crimes against humanity committed on a mammoth scale. It is why the gulf between the Hollywood circus that is the Republican and Democrat National Conventions – with their nauseating celebration of US exceptionalism – and the reality for the millions who have suffered and will continue to suffer regardless of who enters the White House this year exposes US democracy as a sham. It is the best democracy that money can buy. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"Speaking during an exclusive interview with the Times of Israel, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum accused Netanyahu of being personally involved in a bureaucratic process which forced the company to fire its Palestinian employees. According to Birnbaum, it all began when SodaStream decided it needed more space, and opted to close its West Bank factory. The move did, however, follow a boycott campaign\\xa0against the company, in which critics accused it of making money on land “stolen” by Israel.  Though Birnbaum insists the move was made voluntarily, he says the Israeli government is arguing that SodaStream was forced to move due to the pressure from the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as fire the 500 Palestinians working there. But the company insists that despite claims from the Netanyahu government, it wanted to retain 350 of its 500 Palestinian employees to work at its new plant in the Negev. However, according to Birnbaum keeping such a high number of employees was impossible because the company was initially only granted permits for 120 of the Palestinian workers – a number which new conditions later reduced to 74. Since February, those remaining 74 employees have been barred from Israel, their permits retroactively canceled. “Apparently our 74 Palestinians represent a threat to [Netanyahu's] agenda,” Birnbaum said. The CEO says Netanyahu – who he refers to as the “prime minister of conflict” – is responsible for the outcome, adding that his office “intervened to stop the employment of our Palestinians so that Bibi [Netanyahu] can then point a finger at the BDS.” Birnbaum did not mince his words when speaking about the prime minister, accusing him of “systematically spreading hate within Israel between Jews and Arabs and between Orthodox and secular...” “It pains me to say that I believe this administration is nurturing the conflict in all its evil manifestations. They nurture the hate and the boycott and they nurture separatism,” he said. Unsurprisingly, the story coming from Netanyahu's office is starkly different. An official who asked to remain anonymous told the Times of Israel that Birnbaum had relocated his factory because of pressure from the BDS movement. He then noted that once SodaStream was out of the West Bank and inside Israel, it was required to comply with Israeli labor laws – meaning priority had to be given to Israeli workers. “SodaStream went from no quotas at Mishor Adumim, moved inside the Green Line, and was required to follow Israeli labor laws,” the official said. “So it had to lose its Palestinian workers.” The official went on to accuse Birnbaum of being ungrateful towards Netanyahu, as the PM had assisted Birnbaum with a grace period during the transition, arranging for two extensions for Palestinian workers. “The prime minister wanted to help make the transition more smooth. The lack of gratitude is appalling,” the official said. “The PM could have said, ‘We’re not helping him at all.’ Maybe we shouldn’t have helped him. To say it’s personal animus is despicable.” Meanwhile, Birnbaum says that Netanyahu would benefit from taking a leaf out of SodaStream's book, choosing to boost the number of Palestinians working in Israel rather than depriving them of opportunities. He stated that the biggest terrorist threat from Palestinians stems from those working in Israel without permission, stressing that such permits could “buy security.” \"],\n",

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  ' Current EU rules allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content for three reasons: to comply with a member state’s laws, to manage levels of traffic across a network, or for security. The net neutrality rules are intended to prevent broadband operators from favoring specific sources of content such as commercial partners. Blocking porn falls into a gray area, as there is no clear legal framework in UK legislation. However, a revision to the guidelines issued by EU body Berec says blocked content, whether it is porn or ads, should be implemented by a customer on their device, rather than by the network. Frode Sorensen, co-chair of the Berec working group on net neutrality, refused to comment to the Guardian on specific cases or countries, but said the updated guidance made it clear there was no legal basis for using customer choice to justify blocking any content. ISPs Sky, BT and TalkTalk, and mobile operator O2 block access to adult sites following pressure from the government. Mobile operator Three recently ran an ad-blocking trial that required users to opt in. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson told the newspaper the rules still allowed for internet filters. “Family-friendly filters are permitted under the EU net neutrality regulation. The regulations give end-users the right to access information and content of their choice, and enabling/disabling filters exercises this choice.” A spokesperson for BT told the newspaper: “BT offers filtering at both network and device level dependent on the customer’s preferences. “The Berec guidelines are not binding and it’s for Ofcom to consider in its application and enforcement of EU regulations.” It a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom will monitor compliance with the new rules, and look into any complaints received. We will consider any potential breaches as they arise in accordance with our interpretation of the regulation, and drawing upon the Berec guidelines to inform our approach.” '],\n",

              "  'Belgian investigators revealed at least five of the suspects behind the terror attacks on Paris and Brussels were receiving welfare benefits prior to the atrocities. The Wall Street Journal was one of the first media outlets that reported\\xa0on the story.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were receiving welfare benefits?\\xa0 Gerolf Annemans: People must know that Belgium is one of the most Islamised countries of Western Europe. My party especially concentrates on Jihadi fighters coming back from Syria and what they are still receiving after they’ve gone to Syria. Some of them received health care; we repaired their legs, etc. We discovered also that most of these Syrian fighters get allowances after proving that they are not able to get work. So this is a general phenomenon. Now we are very glad, because the Belgium press put this aside, never focused on it and never mentioned it. And we are very glad that The Wall Street Journal does this now and that we are joined now by the international press, because in Belgium the battle is very severe. The media and the regime are doing this because of what we call the Islamosocialism. All governments in Belgium are either left-wing or central-left wing, or at least are doing what they are doing now and what has been discovered now.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system. What should be done to prevent them from receiving welfare payments?\\xa0 GA: First of all, we have to choose other leaders, elect other leaders; leaders that have steel teeth, and can bite and can fight against Islamization of our society, and for instance blocking the social security. It is an enormous tragedy that we are in this paradox that the Belgium taxpayers paid for this Islamic attacks. We need other leaders, we need other leadership, we need to rethink our western democracies.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Do you think there could be more incidents like this?\\xa0 GA: Well, we have the tragedy of the asylum seekers, the millions that come now and that are all on our social security, because only a tiny minority gets work and helps our economy, or deals with our economy. So most of them end up in our social security system, which is, by the way, the reason why they come to Europe. They don’t stop where it is safe, or where there are no bullets shot anymore. They stop where there is social security. That is why they come to Germany, to Belgium, to Holland, and not to the other countries that they travel leaving Syria. This is a serious mistake to think that we have to change the people of Europe, that we have to exchange them with a new Islamic and mostly Muslim people. This is a failure, a mistake, politically, culturally, in every sense of the word.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Many of the attacks were carried out not by refugees, but by the people who were born or raised in the EU. How do you propose to deal with those kind of people?\\xa0 GA: These people, the people that are here, and are peaceful, and are not radicalizing, or are not promoting Muslim society on Western Europe soil, these people should get the message from our politicians, from our political regimes that they should adapt to our culture of our society. And for the rest we should close the borders that the EU opened widely. We must not let [Angela] Merkel decide our future. People and countries like ours should decide upon that themselves. The Merkel, the [Jean-Claude] Juncker, and the EU way of dealing with these problems is not the way we want it. The people should stand up and vote for leaders in their countries that promise to stop all these.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were getting welfare benefits?\\xa0 Jean Bricmont: I think that is a very bad argument. Of course, if the people knew that they were plotting terrorist attack then it was not a matter of cutting welfare, but putting them away in jail, or under surveillance, or something. The argument against welfare, which is used here, is very bad. It suggests that we should cut welfare, but to whom? To all the Muslim, to all the suspects, to everybody? The present government is already cutting welfare, and welfare has been cut and cut over the years. I think if anything it will probably increase the danger, because it would put more people in a precarious situation, which may lead them to violent action. I don’t think welfare is the problem at all. In fact fiscal fraud is much, much bigger than the welfare spending. So if welfare could prevent the terrorist attack it would be a very small amount of money. You might find it shocking that people on welfare kill other people, but what is shocking is not that they get welfare, but that they kill other people. If they had a job and were not receiving welfare, I would find it just as terrible and shocking.\\xa0\\xa0 It seems to me that The Wall Street Journal, in line with its neoliberal agenda, is trying to use this argument against welfare, which I think is a very bad argument. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is psychologically shocking, but stop and think about it. Stop welfare to whom?\\xa0 If we know that they are terrorists than it is not a matter of welfare, it is a matter of putting them under police control – so a very different business.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system.\\xa0 You would prefer then to ignore that fact, wouldn’t you?\\xa0 JB: Well, the question is: what did the police know? Obviously we should fight the Islamic State. I myself would be in favor of joining Russia in Syria and fighting them, other than doing what\\xa0 we do, which is inefficient bombing. That is a problem on the ground, it is not a problem of Belgian citizens, or even migrants in European countries…\\xa0 RT: How do you assess the level of security in the EU right now in the wake of a spate of horrific attacks, many of which were carried out by refugees?\\xa0 JB: It is pretty bad, but the point is that they are not refugees. Many of these people were citizens of the European countries. They grew up here. I don’t know every individual case, but many of the terrorists grew up here. They got very upset with… the trouble we created in the Middle East and the instability we created there.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Although the votes are still being counted in some states, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote with nearly 59.8 million votes, compared to Trump’s almost 59.6 million votes \\xa0– a lead of about 0.2 percentage points or more than 200,000 votes. Winning the popular vote is a bitter consolation prize for Clinton, as overall victory is based on the 538 members of the Electoral College, each of whom represent a state or the District of Columbia based on population. The number of electoral voters a state gets is equal to its representation in Congress, with a minimum of three (Delaware, DC, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) and a maximum of 55 (California). The winning candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. With Michigan (16) and New Hampshire (4) still outstanding, Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton only 218. Trump is set to become the second president in 16 years to win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote; George W. Bush was the first in the controversial 2000 election. However, it happened twice in 12 years in the 1800s: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Hayes suffered the biggest loss in the popular vote, losing by 3 percentage points to Southern Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Trump comes in second at 1.2 points. Both Bush and Harrison lost by less than a point to Vice President Al Gore and incumbent President Grover Cleveland respectively, according to Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidents. There is one other time that a president entered the White House without winning the popular vote, but that was in 1824, due to a four-way race that did not produce a winner in the Electoral College, forcing the House of Representatives to decide, in accordance with the 12th Amendment. The House elected John Quincy Adams as president. At that point in time, candidates did not run as a combined presidential and vice presidential ticket, and John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency outright. The situation that Trump finds himself in is thus relatively rare, but shifting demographics in the country mean that it could happen more often in the future, according to Vox. The US is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2055, there will not be a single racial or ethnic majority, the Pew Research Center found ahead of the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meeting. Most of those population gains by minorities are occurring in solidly Democratic and solidly Republican states, which means that they did nothing to shift the electoral map. While Trump made headway into all racial and ethnic groups compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, it was still whites who handed him his victory, with 58 percent voting for him, compared to 37 percent for Clinton. Whites made up 70 percent of voters on Tuesday. Trump gained 7 percentage points among black voters, 8 points among Hispanic and Latinos, 11 percent among Asians and 1 percent among other ethnic groups, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polling. However, that doesn’t mean he did well among those groups. The vast majority of black voters (88 percent) chose Clinton, as did 65 percent each of Hispanic/Latino and Asian voters, while 56 percent of people belonging to other ethnic groups voted for Clinton. Millennials ‒ in this case defined as those born after 1980 ‒ have likely replaced the baby boomers as the largest generation. Trump again made headway with this group, gaining 5 points over Romney, but lost the group overall. More than half (55 percent) voted for Clinton, while only 37 percent opted for Trump. It was voters age 45 and older ‒ the baby boomers and Generation X ‒ who gave him the victory, with 53 percent voting for Trump. So basically, Trump won because of older white people, according to @nytimes & @cnn analyses of exit polling pic.twitter.com/rkfXLWixau If millennials had been the only voters, it would have been a landslide victory for Clinton in the Electoral College. Instead, however, they were in the minority, making up only 44 percent of voters on Tuesday. This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision. pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869 There is one place that the popular vote does matter, however: third parties. If a third-party candidate receives 5 percent of the vote, then their party is eligible to receive federal grants from the Federal Election Commission in the 2020 general election. Unfortunately for Libertarian Gary Johnson (less than 4.1 million), Green Jill Stein (just over 1.2 million) and independent Evan McMullin (about 423,000), none of them reached the necessary milestone. If all their votes were to be combined, they would come to just under 5.7 million, or about half a million votes short. '],\n",

              "  \"The yearly manned space flights, part of Russia’s moon exploration program, will include flyovers and landings on the lunar surface. In order to achieve these goals, Russia plans to use a new type of a manned spacecraft called the Federatsiya (Federation). Russian space rocket corporation Energia will start construction of the spacecraft and software development this summer, the company’s chief designer told journalists. The Federatsiya will be a new generation vessel to replace the currently used Soyuz spaceships. It is designed for transferring people and delivering cargo to the moon and the International Space Station (ISS). Its crew will be four to six cosmonauts. The spaceship is expected to be able to operate autonomously for up to 30 days. It can be deployed to the ISS for up to one year. The testing of the spacecraft is expected to start in 2021, with an unmanned flight launched from Russia’s new Vostochny spaceport in the Far Eastern Amur region. The first test will be followed by two more launches in 2023, including one manned flight. The Angara A5B heavy carrier rocket will be used for the launches, TASS reports. Earlier, it was reported that Federatsiya test flights will include four launches, two of which will be manned and one will involve a flyover of the moon. Energia Corporation has already unveiled another project designed for a potential lunar trip. The company presented draft plans for a new reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the ISS and the moon called the Ryvok (Charge of Breakthrough) at the Human Space Exploration international conference in Korolev, near Moscow, on May 26. The Ryvok spacecraft will be permanently based on the ISS – or its descendant – and will serve as the mid-way shuttle for delivering cargo and crews to the moon, the representatives of the company said at the conference, adding that Ryvok will be much more cost efficient compared to the Federatsiya spacecraft. The Energia Corporation and NASA are also discussing a project to create a joint space station orbiting the moon, which could be put into operation by the end of the next decade, Energia's representative Yuri Makushenko told journalists at the conference.

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Sunday’s general election Russia saw people vote for members of the lower house, the State Duma and several regional heads. With almost all the votes counted, the ruling United Russia party is likely to secure the majority of seats in the Duma. It's followed by the Russian Communist party (KPRF) and the Liberal Democrats (LDPR), who are neck and neck. Fair Russia has also made it to the lower house with about 6 percent of the votes. The result of the vote didn’t come as any surprise. Various polls and analysts predicted United Russia was going to remain the majority party. However, Western media criticized the election dubbing it “a show” and “a farce” even before it started. Yvan Blot, former member of the French and European Parliaments, says this election result reminded him of the French presidential elections when Charles de Gaulle “had 50 percent of the votes.” “It is the same now in Russia with United Russia, Putin’s party. What strikes me is that all political parties in the majority and in the opposition are patriotic. It is not the case in France, I must admit,” he told RT. Former French MP Blot, commenting on the matter said Western countries should mind their own election process. State Duma elections start in Russia https://t.co/bQvOEODkBO For instance, in France, the system “is less democratic than the Russian one,” he said. He referred to the way Russian lawmakers are elected to the Duma: half of the MPs are elected from single-mandate districts (one candidate per district), the other half - from party candidate lists on a proportional basis. “In France we have a more simple system: every candidate comes from a constituency. But constituencies were designed by the most powerful party some years ago. With the result of 1/3 of the votes the National Front has only two members of Parliament. Is that democratic? It is not democratic at all. It is the same for the extreme left. [It] has very few members of Parliament, but they have voices,” he said. “Besides, candidates in France are selected in general by little committees of oligarchs within political parties. We have no primaries, except now in the Republican Party Presidential election. But in general it is not a tradition to have primaries,” Blot said. Primaries had not been a common thing for Russia either until this year, when ahead of the September 18 parliamentary vote, United Russia held nationwide primaries. The third “big problem” in France, according to Blot, is that opinions of political leaders differ from those of voters. “For that reason people are very deceived by all political parties. In France the rate of trust for a political party is only 18 per cent of the people. I think we have no lesson to give to Russia about democracy. Russia is not perfect – perfection doesn’t exist in the world. But I think the system has much improved since some years and now it is more democratic than in France,” the former MP said. Adam Garrie, author at The Duran says the Western media painted the Russian vote “as a show” because they “don’t want to admit that the democracy in Russia is indeed one of the most vibrant and, more importantly, diverse in the free world”. “When you just listen to some of the many debates in the Duma, you’ve got a broader range of opinions than you’ve got in the British Parliament, in the US Congress, or most places in Europe,” he told RT. In recent years, the Russian government has introduced a number of changes to make elections more representative. For instance, the threshold for parties to get into parliament was lowered to 5 percent and a prominent human rights activist, Ella Pamfilova was appointed to head the Central Election Commission. Garrie explains Western media have an agenda, “and the agenda doesn’t rely on the facts”. “The fact of the matter is that the Russian government has gone out of its way to make this one of the most widespread free and fair elections possible from opening polling stations in some of the most remotest parts of the world – to videotaping all the polling stations to catch any possible irregularities when and as they happen. This factual truth isn’t something that seems to match the Western narrative – that says the Russian electoral system is somehow backwards or undemocratic. Perhaps they are ashamed that the Russian system is slightly more democratic and certainly more ideologically and personally diverse than a lot of place in the so-called West,” he said.\\xa0 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \"],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'According to an official notification from the national RTA SE media body, the suspension will come into force in 60 days. The channel will be excluded from free transmission, but will still remain in paid TV packages. The media governing body expressed its “gratitude” for a fruitful cooperation and the contribution of RT Spanish to the national satellite and digital broadcasts in a letter signed by RTA’s Maria Eugenia Martinez, who emphasized that current notification of suspension “does not prevent the conclusion of other future partnerships.” On June 7, a similar letter was sent to the pan-Latin American terrestrial and satellite television network TeleSUR TV, notifying that its broadcasting in Argentina would be suspended within 15 days. TeleSUR President Patricia Villegas denounced the move as “censorship” on the part of the right-wing Argentine president Mauricio Macri and his government. Both letters cited the “need to renew the program listings” of Argentina’s Experimental System of Digital Terrestrial Television and Satellite Television Systems as the reason for suspensions. Censura @mauriciomacri a @teleSURtv#NoNosCallarán#TeleSURConArgentinapic.twitter.com/Mxb3l9UfE9 “The official explanation has been that they need those channels presently occupied by the RT Spanish signal, and also the TeleSur Venezuela signal. The government is saying, officially, that they need those two frequency slots to transmit provincial channels, channels from Argentinian provinces, for example Tierra del Fuego which is way down in the South,” said international political analyst and RT contributor Adrian Salbuchi. “But that is hardly a credible explanation of any sort whatsoever.” READ MORE: RT and Venezuela TeleSUR journalists unite to provide fresh perspective on news “RT and also TeleSUR… definitely [have] a very alternative view on international politics, finance, economic treaties, for example like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so forth… regrettably, what we are seeing at least in Argentina is a case of censorship where the government does not want alternative viewpoint… to be heard by the Argentinian population,” Salbuchi added. OP-EGDE: ‘RT broadcast halt in Argentina is all-out psychological onslaught on Latin America’ “I think that part of this is an effort to deny the citizens of Argentina the opportunity to hear a plurality of voices about what is taking place in other countries in the region,” believes RT Spanish “Behind the News” host and attorney Eva Golinger. “This is a government that has just completed six months in office. It’s a really narrow timeframe, and yet they’ve already taken harsh measures… TeleSUR may have had a more critical voice towards the government, but this is a government that ran on a platform saying they were promoting wider democracy and more freedoms in Argentina. And now we are seeing that what they are actually doing is the opposite.” Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Upper House committee for foreign affairs, said that the main reason for RT’s suspension “is the shift in the power in Argentina” after pro-American Mauricio Macri became president in late 2015. According to the official, the move is one of the first signs of Argentina’s rapprochement with the US. “The US always and everywhere are trying to consistently monopolize the information realm and remove all other alternative sources of information. We know how concerned the US authorities are by the popularity of RT,” Kosachev stressed. The decision to launch RT’s Spanish-language channel as part of the Latin American country’s national television broadcast in 2014 was applauded by the presidents of Russia and Argentina. “Harsh information wars and the attempts of some countries to monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests have become a sign of modern times,”\\xa0President Vladimir Putin said at the time, stressing that “in these circumstances alternative sources of information are particularly in demand. RT is definitely one of them.” Former Argentinian leader\\xa0Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\\xa0also praised the initiative back in 2014 saying, “we are really glad to welcome RT Spanish in Television Digital Terrestre (TDA), which is available all over the country.”  '],\n",

The actions \"could amount to war crimes,\" he warned. Government-held West Aleppo has been under constant fire from the rebel-controlled East for several weeks now with many civilians, including children, falling victim to the attacks. RT: Do you think there will be, at some point, an official investigation into human rights violations committed by rebel groups as they continue with their attacks on western Aleppo? Jim Jatras: Well, there certainly should be and the question whether they will be is very difficult to answer because, remember, these are groups supported by the US and other Western countries and by our allies in the region - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so forth. Despite the fact that these are terrorist groups, that they are Al-Qaeda and their various allies, and they are very reluctant to put a spotlight on the kind of people that we’re supporting in this region. Let’s remember, a couple of months ago the Al-Zinki group was alleged of using chlorine gas. And the State Department spokesman was asked, ‘if we were shown [that] they used chlorine gas, would we drop our support for them?’ And he refused to answer. So I’m afraid we’re going to see a roadblock put in by Western governments to avoid that kind of investigation. RT: If they continue to commit what may amount to war crimes, could the rebels lose Western support? In terms of public opinion, is there any chance we\\'ll start seeing a shift in attitude toward armed opposition groups in Syria? JJ: It is certainly out of the bag for people who watch RT and who tune into alternative media. But as far as the American mainstream media goes, it is not out of the bag at all. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups. I would be very interested to see in the very next couple of days, will the American and other Western European mainstream media report this and pin the blame where it belongs - on these terrorists and on the governments that are supporting them. RT: Are the attacks and potential war crimes receiving sufficient coverage to sway public opinion? JJ: Absolutely not. These attacks are not new, these attacks against West Aleppo have been going on continuously and they receive zero reporting in the Western media. I monitor the American media pretty closely, and look at the double standards on how they report on say the offensive against Mosul versus the offensive against East Aleppo. They are night and day difference and I have not heard any reports of terrorist attacks on West Aleppo in the American media. RT: In their latest assault, it appears the rebels used chlorine gas. Where are they likely to have acquired such weapons or the materials required for their assembly? JJ: We’ve had a couple of instances with sarin, for example. There have been allegations in the past that this has been done inside Turkey. I am not in a position to verify that, but given that that’s the main route of the supply for the terrorists, that would be a reasonable speculation to start with. Moderate radical groups are like a Trojan Horse that Western countries and the Gulf States put inside Syria, says Dr. Said Sadiq, professor of political sociology at the American University of Cairo. RT: Staffan de Mistura has condemned the rebel’s actions in Aleppo. Will Western politicians and media now shift their attention to the atrocities the rebels are committing? Dr. Said Sadiq: Despite the fact that not Mistura alone but also the UN Secretary General also condemned what is happening, but all Western media attention is going now to the battle of Mosul in Iraq and what is happening in Aleppo is being sidestepped and played down in international media… RT: Today there was a chemical gas attack in western Aleppo. Will the West reassess its support for these so called moderate groups if it is confirmed the rebels conducted it? SS: We have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf States invested in those moderate radical groups and so they cannot abandon them. They are like the Trojan Horse that they had put inside the Syrian domestic situation. They cannot pull out now and say: “Okay, we discovered that we were wrong, let’s get out and leave them.” They have invested in them and they will still use them in bargaining in the future of Syria. So, if there are any future negotiations on the fate of Syria, those people, these cards of radicals and moderates will be used on the negotiating table. I don’t think that they will get rid of them soon. Secondly, how did they get all those chemical weapons? The Gulf States provide weapons but they don’t have chemicals. So, most likely the chemical weapons had come from a NATO country. Because these are the only countries that have such kind of weapons. How did these chemical weapons come to the Syrian rebels? You will have the usual suspect –Turkey. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups.\\xa0 RT: The UK plans to launch a new program to train rebels and supply them with weapons. Last year a similar program was a complete failure and ended up with the rebels fighting alongside ISIS and Al-Nusra. Will the same happen again? SS: Six years of wasted resources and money to destroy Syria and they failed. The objective that was declared: “We will topple the Assad regime.” Six years and nothing happened. Do you think that one more year or more investment will tip the iceberg and change what we have seen? I doubt it. I think it was wasted money and they had one strategic aim: They don’t want the gas coming from Qatar to cross Syria to Europe and also to destroy the Syrian society, not the Syrian regime, Syrian society, the Syrian army, Syrian territorial integrity.

Stoltenberg mentioned in his speech that the facility does not pose any threat to the Russian Federation, but this statement was immediately questioned by Russian politicians and officials. “We have been saying right from when this story started that our experts are convinced that the deployment of the ABM system poses a certain threat to the Russian Federation,” President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"Measures are being taken to ensure the necessary level of security for Russia. The president himself, let me remind you, has repeatedly asked who the system will work against [if not Russia].” READ MORE: ‘Certainly it’s a threat’: Moscow rejects NATO claims ABM site safe for Russia The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\\'s Department for Proliferation and Arms Control Issues, Mikhail Ulyanov, told reporters last week that the move had an adverse effect on strategic stability, adding that the direct interests of Russia’s security are affected by this event. He added that by launching the Romanian base the United States violated the 1987 INF treaty under which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed their respective countries up to obligations “not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500km to 5,500km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.” Also last week the US commenced the construction of an ABM site in Poland, due to be ready by late 2018.

The average number of rape cases annually registered by police was nearly half that figure at 395, according to the Justice Ministry’s investigation, Metroxpress\\xa0reports. The majority of unrecorded rape incidents ended up as cases with inconclusive evidence, as there were doubts whether rapes had been committed. This approach to statistics was dropped in November 2015, but still an unknown number of cases are not reflected in the data.The Justice Ministry says the real number of rape cases totals an average of 1,100 a year. “It is a huge number, but it doesn’t surprise me that the actual number is higher than the official one,” Hanne Baden Nielsen, director of the Center for Sexual Assault, said describing the revelations as “astonishing.” Her comments were reported by The Local.

However, Soren Pind, Denmark`s Justice Minister, denied that the incorrect data was a result of an intentional cover-up and stressed the need to improve the accuracy of statistics. “I don’t think anyone in the system actually wanted to hide these things,” she told Metroexpress, adding that the authorities intend to monitor the police’s actions in this area more closely. “We are bringing in a monitoring of this area. If any case is suspended, reasons must be given, so now we will get a useful statistic.” On Wednesday, a Danish teenage girl was sexually assaulted by an English-speaking man in the center of the small town of Sonderborg . The attacker knocked her down and was about to assault her when she used pepper spray to defend herself, forcing him to flee the scene. However, police charged her with possessing a weapon, saying it is illegal to carry and use pepper sprays, according to reports in local media. Earlier, it was reported that women were subject to harassment by asylum seekers in at least three Danish cities. Several incidents occurred in the town of Thisted, where a refugee camp for 365 asylum seekers is located. Cases of sexual abuse were also registered in the Danish cities of Sonderborg and Hardeslev, where several local nightspots owners imposed “language controls” requiring visitors to prove their ability to speak Danish, German or French, following complaints from women. Since 551 women reported being sexual harassed on New Year’s Eve in the German city of Cologne, allegedly committed by groups of migrants of North African origin, the problem of sexually-related violence in Europe has been in the media spotlight.

              "  '“The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,” Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, adding that it was done deliberately and on purpose. “This idea was planted into the US public consciousness… with only one goal… to protect the interests of the Democratic candidate in her competition with the candidate of the Republicans, in this case – with Mr. Trump,” the Russian president stressed. The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. “The ‘Russian card’ has been used to demonize one particular candidate – to tie him with Russia, which is not particularly popular in the US at the moment and therefore to diminish his prospects,” former British diplomat Alastair Crooke told RT. He also warned that the deliberate “demonization of Russia in every aspect” used as a political tool during the US presidential campaign will have “a substantive long-term effect on the relations, whoever will be president.” “It will make it very, very difficult for [the future US president] to start a new relationship with the Russian president afterwards,” Crooke stressed. His words were partly echoed by writer John Wight, who told RT that accusing Russia of meddling with the US election process on behalf of Donald Trump is “reckless and very dangerous because whoever will be the next president, he or she is going to deal with Russia.” At the same time, Wight stressed, “it is in the interest of the US people as well as of the people of the whole world that the US reset relations with Russia.” Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. “He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin.

This sort of internationalization is in line with China’s wish for increased legitimacy of its currency. The move is also evidence of China’s growing role as a power to challenge the global economic dominance of the United States.

The people behind the project say these are the first indoor farming installations of their kind, placed directly in supermarkets. \"Imagine a future where cities become self-sufficient in their food production, where autonomous farms grow fresh premium produce at affordable prices, eliminating waste and environmental impact,\" INFARM says. The farms look like a tiny greenhouse inside the store where shoppers can pick their own freshly harvested salad greens and herbs right from the growing plants. The advantages of the indoor micro-farms are lower transport costs and associated emissions. They use less water, energy and space than conventional farms and horizontal greenhouses. The vertical greenhouses currently grow only herbs and salad greens but the company says they can be reconfigured to growing other crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and others. INFARM’s Berlin pilot program with vertical mini-farms will end in six months after which the company plans expanding into other supermarket locations. It is also considering putting similar modules into restaurants and hotels which want to offer something unique to their clients and guests. INFARM began several years ago as an indoor urban farming startup with an origami-inspired micro-garden project.

              "  'WADA says athletes who are found to have less than 1 mcg of meldonium in doping tests carried out before March 1, 2016, could be allowed to compete again. Tennis player Maria Sharapova and swimmer Yulia Efimova were two of around 40 Russian athletes who failed drug tests for meldonium.\\xa0 “If the anti-doping organization finds that the athlete could not reasonably have known or suspected that the substance would still be present in his/her body on or after 1 January 2016, then a finding of no fault or negligence may be made,” a press release\\xa0from WADA stated.\\xa0 However, WADA said this was not an “amnesty,” rather it was an acceptance that organizations should take occurrences on a case by case basis. \"In no way does this serve as an \\'amnesty\\' for athletes that are asserted to have committed an anti-doping rule violation,\" WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told AP in an email. \"Rather, it serves as guidance for how anti-doping organizations should assess the particular circumstances of each individual case under their jurisdiction.\"\\xa0 In the statement, WADA admitted that more tests need to be carried out to find out how long meldonium can remain in the blood stream, a point which has been argued by Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko.\\xa0 “In the case of meldonium, there is currently a lack of clear scientific information on excretion times. For this reason, a hearing panel might justifiably find (unless there is specific evidence to the contrary) that an athlete who has established, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she ingested meldonium before 1 January 2016, could not reasonably have known or suspected the meldonium would still be present in his or her body on or after 1 January 2016. In these circumstances, WADA considers there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,” the statement continued.\\xa0 WADA can confirm there have been 172 Adverse Analytical Findings (positives) for Meldonium since it was banned on 1st January 2016 #WADA Athletes around the world were told meldonium was to be added to WADA’s list of banned substances in September 2015, while the ban came into effect on January 1, 2016.\\xa0 One of those who is set to gain from WADA’s decision is Sharapova. She said she had been taking meldonium for more than a decade because of health problems and was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in March after announcing she had failed a test at the Australian Open in Melbourne. However, the Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev said Sharapova’s ban could be addressed in a meeting with ITF head David Haggerty later this month. “The situation with Sharapova could be resolved after April 21 when we meet with the head of the international federation. After that all should be become clear. It is too early to talk about Sharapova competing at the Olympic Games,” TASS quoted Tarpishchev as saying, as cited by Reuters. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was happy that WADA had been flexible regarding meldonium in a statement on its website, as cited by TASS.\\xa0 “The Russian Sports Ministry supports and welcomes the decision made by WADA because it has showed a willingness to understand the situation, rather than stick to the rulebook. They were ready to study how long it would take for meldonium to be eliminated from the body of an athlete. WADA has sent recommendations to all the anti-doping organizations, which will allow them to make fair decisions based on the actual guilt of an athlete. In doing so, WADA has demonstrated impartiality and being objective in the fight against doping.”\\xa0 The five-time speed skating world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov and the 2014 Olympic short track gold medalist Semen Elistratov are two athletes who are set to benefit from WADA’s ruling, and the president of the Russian Speed Skating Union Aleksey Kravtsov told R-Sport that the pair should be allowed to compete again.\\xa0 “These sportsmen should be allowed to fall under the amnesty due to the amount found in their doping tests. They were not guilty, as we had been saying earlier. This is of course good news, but there is still a bit of a cloud hanging over all of this,” he said. '],\n",

The active shooter situation declared in Baton Rouge on Sunday has come to an end, the gunman is dead, he added. \"We do not have an active shooter scenario in Baton Rouge,\" Edmonson said. Louisiana authorities will hold another press conference regarding the Baton Rouge shootings at 1pm CDT (1800 GMT) on Monday, Reuters reported. According to earlier reports, police believed there could have been at least two more suspects on the loose. Three officers out of five transported to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital have died from their injuries. Two others remain in hospital, with one being in fair condition and the other in a critical state, according to WAFB and Reuters.\\xa0The condition of the third policeman transported to the hospital remains unknown. The Baton Rouge police department reportedly used\\xa0a robot to check the area for explosive devices.\\xa0 “We do know, and do believe there are more than one suspect. That’s why we’re alerting the community. We sending in the robot to see if there are any explosives in the area or any explosives on him,” said Corporal L’Jean McKneely, WAFB reported. Two of the officers killed were from the Baton Rouge police, and the third was an East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s deputy, Baton Rouge Chief Administrative Officer William Daniel said earlier, as cited by The Advocate. The shooting took place at the B-Quik convenience store at a gas station, Baton Rouge police said, according to AP. The body of the suspect was found outside the store, at the door of a nearby fitness club. The city was\\xa0on high alert following the incident. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Casey Rayborn Hicks said earlier\\xa0that one gunman had been killed, and\\xa0police believed two more shooters may have been at large. WAFB said\\xa0that the shootout began in the early hours of Sunday morning on Airline Highway near Old Hammond Highway in Baton Rouge, less than one mile from police headquarters.\\xa0 Police reportedly have no clear picture on what started the shooting, but it seems there was a running gun fight in the area of the shopping center and convenience store. They were first notified of the incident at about 8:45 a.m. Sunday. Baton Rouge police responded to a call reporting a “suspicious person walking down Airline Highway with an assault rifle,”\\xa0a CNN source said, adding that the person opened fire as soon as the police squad arrived. According to a witness, there were at least 25-30 gunshots heard before police arrived, WAFB reported.

The attack follows the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old black man, Alton Sterling, by two white police officers in Baton Rouge earlier in July. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake responded to a call that a man was allegedly using a gun to threaten another man outside a convenience store. Following the arrival of the police, Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point-blank range. The two officers, who are both currently suspended, claimed Sterling reached for a gun before being shot at by law enforcers. In a video recording of the incident, one of the officers, presumably Salamoni, shouted “He’s got a gun! Gun!” prompting his partner to pull out his service pistol and fire several shots. The US Department of Justice is leading a criminal investigation into the case, joined by the FBI and state police of Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Baton Rouge Police Department over the response to the protests that followed. “The lawsuit alleges that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to disperse protesters who were gathered peacefully to speak out against the police killing of Alton Sterling,” the ACLU said in a statement. The shooting led to massive protests against police violence in the US. One of the demonstrations spilled into yet more bloodshed. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 while guarding a rally against excessive use of force by police. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Micah Johnson, used a sniper rifle while targeting officers in what was reported to be a revenge attack for police killings of black people. \"We\\'re convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement – make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement\\'s efforts to punish people of color,\" Dallas Police Chief David said following the incident. Following a standoff with law enforcers Johnson was shot dead. He had served as a reservist in the army until April 2015 and was also deployed to Afghanistan from November 2003 to July 2014. Officials noted that they did not believe the man was part of a terrorist organization and that the assault was a lone-wolf attack. '],\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  ' “This is political rhetoric that does not have great significance and does not take into account the real situation in Syria,” Putin told French TV channel TF1 during an interview in the central Russian city of Kovrov, when asked about the accusations that have been leveled by Francois Hollande, UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, and the Obama administration. Putin then accused the West of destabilizing the region – citing the Arab Spring in 2011 as a key flashpoint for tensions that still dominate the Muslim world. “I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries,” said Putin. “Remember how everyone rushed to support the Arab Spring? Where is that optimism now? How did it all end? Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our western partners’ forces?” Putin linked the volatility in the region to the recent spate of large-scale terrorist attacks in the West, which have either been planned or inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have thrived in the chaos. “[Before the Arab Spring] these Middle Eastern countries were not examples of democracies as we understand the word today, and there probably was a need and possibility to influence these societies’ organization, the state organization, and the nature of these regimes,” said Putin, who was attending a festival dedicated to Sambo, a Russian combat sport. “But whatever the case, these states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d’Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.” Putin also detailed his version of the breakdown of the long-negotiated joint operation between Washington and Moscow in Syria, claiming the key turning point was the September 16 US-led coalition strike on a Syrian army unit, which the Pentagon maintains was accident. “Our American colleagues told us that this airstrike was made in error. This error cost the lives of 80 people and, also just coincidence, perhaps, ISIS took the offensive immediately afterwards. At the same time, lower down the ranks, at the operations level, one of the American military service personnel said quite frankly that they spent several days preparing this strike. How could they make an error if they were several days in preparation?” said Putin. “This is how our ceasefire agreement ended up broken. Who broke the agreement? Was it us? No.” Several western powers have since blamed Russia for what they claim was a retaliatory strike on a UN convoy on September 20. Washington has now broken off any bilateral talks with Moscow over Syria. But Putin says that Russia is still open to helping resolve what the UN has termed the worst humanitarian crisis since the war – which has likely killed over 400,000 people – began five years ago. “It has been proposed that our armed units, Russian military personnel, be deployed on the road to ensure transit safety [for aid convoys to Aleppo]. The Russian military, who are courageous and decisive people, have said they would do it,” said Putin, who said that the initiative, which had not previously been made public, was an “exotic proposal.” “But I told them that this could only be done jointly with the US, and ordered them to make the proposal. We have proposed this, and they [the Americans] promptly refused. They do not want to deploy their troops there, but they also do not want to pull back opposition groups – who are, in fact, terrorists. What can we do in this situation?” Despite the downbeat tone of the interview, Putin insisted he was still “optimistic” about a diplomatic solution in Syria, and claimed that the offer to “reschedule” next week’s visit to France, which was canceled following a diplomatic snub by Francois Hollande, was genuine. “This is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo. But we are always open, of course, to any consultations and dialogue on this matter,” said Putin. WATCH MORE:  '],\n",

              "  'Ankara has demanded to have comedian Jan Boehmermann prosecuted for insulting a foreign head of state.\\xa0 Under a section of Germany\\'s criminal code, the government has to authorize prosecutors to pursue a case against the comedian. The code, known as Paragraph 103, concerns insults against organs or representatives of foreign states. However, it is so rarely used that many German politicians and lawyers were previously unaware of its existence. \"Turkey has demanded prosecution of Jan Boehmermann. [The] German government, in accordance with established practice, studied the note; this process involved the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Office of the Federal Chancellor. As a result, the federal government in regard to this incident, satisfies the request,\" Merkel told reporters\\xa0at the\\xa0Chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor went on to stress that it \"means\\xa0neither a prejudgment of the person affected nor a decision about the limits of freedom of art, the press and opinion.\" Merkel said that the government intends to repeal the law, effective in 2018.\\xa0 \"There were different opinions between the coalition partners - the conservatives and the SPD (Social Democrats),\" Merkel added. On Friday, German politicians from the “Green” party criticized Merkel\\'s decision to satisfy Ankara’s request, branding it a political mistake. “I believe Merkel’s decision is a political mistake. She has set up a trap for herself by politicizing the case, now she has to live with the accusation that the deal with Turkey [over the refugee crisis] became more important to her than freedom of speech,” Anton Hofreiter, head of the Green party, told TV channel N24. “Merkel should have made it clear from the start that we in Germany have a free press, while Erdogan should take better care of the press at home.” The head of the Social Democratic Party, Thomas Operman, also condemned Merkel’s move.\\xa0 “This decision is wrong. Prosecution of satire due to “lese-majeste” does not correspond with modern democracy,\" Operman wrote on Twitter. The German Union of Journalists (DJV) in their turn said such measures proposed by the chancellor do not correspond with German laws, adding that Merkel gave the “wrong signals” on the case to the Turkish government. “There was no need for the decision since the Turkish president has already filed a complaint to the Mainz Prosecutor.” On Monday, Erdogan filed a private lawsuit before sending a note to the German government demanding criminal prosecution of the presenter. Boehmermann read the\\xa0poem on Germany\\'s ZDF television two weeks ago. Although the\\xa0broadcaster withdrew the piece from its archives,\\xa0it said that no laws were broken. However, Boehmermann warned ahead of time that the reading would breach regulation on insulting foreign leaders.\\xa0 The Turkish government says the poem accused Erdogan of\\xa0“repressing minorities, kicking Kurds, and slapping Christians while watching child porn.” Turkey\\'s own press freedom has come under serious attack in recent months, including from Germany.\\xa0 In March, Ankara reportedly\\xa0pressured\\xa0Berlin into removing a satirical clip aired by public broadcaster NDR, which criticized the president for his crackdown on freedom of speech, as well as the alleged shuffling of electorate votes and cracking down on women. Earlier that month,\\xa0a correspondent for Germany\\'s Der Spiegel magazine was forced\\xa0to leave Turkey after his press credentials weren\\'t removed. The publication\\'s editor-in-chief accused Ankara of violating press freedom. Also last month, employees of Turkey\\'s Zaman newspaper said\\xa0they “feel like captives” following the government\\'s takeover of the daily. Since the paper\\'s seizure, it has has turned into a government mouthpiece, with the first edition under the new ownership immediately featuring a picture of Erdogan.\\xa0 Meanwhile, two journalists from Turkey\\'s Cumhuriyet newspaper are being charged with espionage after publishing a report in 2014 which purported to show Turkey\\'s state intelligence agency helping to transfer weapons into Syria by truck. The two spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the Constitutional Court ruled in February that their pre-trial detention was a violation of their rights. The journalists\\' detainment prompted criticism from international human rights groups, as well as from the EU and US Vice President Joe Biden, who said that Turkey was setting a poor example for the region by intimidating the media.

Asked whether “the federal government has the refugee situation under control,” 81 percent of Germans answered “No,” with just 18 percent saying “Yes.” Those answering “No” also included members of Merkel’s Christian Social Union, with a notable 67 percent of the party’s voters unhappy with the chancellor’s policies. Voter support for Merkel’s government dropped from 57 percent in July 2015 to 38 percent on February 2016 – “the worst estimate during the current government’s term,” the pollster said. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which advocates an anti-immigrant agenda became the third most influential party. It was projected to get 12 percent of the vote if the federal election were held this Sunday. Most Germans also think more restrictive measures towards refugees and asylum seekers must follow. A remarkable 88 percent believe the government should curb benefits for refugees who fail or are unwilling to integrate into German society, with 10 percent saying “No” – a measure previously announced by Germany’s Labor Minister Andrea Nahles. Introducing tougher border control on the EU’s external frontiers and a more detailed processing of asylum seeker applications, debated over the past months in Germany, was also widely supported. Some 63 percent said “Yes” to install the EU’s external border, while 33 percent were opposed. Consequently, 53 percent of Germans said border controls within EU countries – seen as threatening the Schengen border-free zone by many in Brussels – should be introduced as well. According to 77 percent of respondents Europe must also set up refugee centers at the EU’s external borders to process migrants’ applications and send back ineligible asylum seekers. The poll came alongside the so-called “Asylum package II” (Asylpaket II) – the newest set of measures by the German government designed to toughen refugee policies. The package includes putting limits on the number of asylum seekers admitted to Europe, and also an attempt to integrate those who have already reached Germany.

READ MORE: ‘American exceptionalism’ hampers its war on terror – Lavrov “Any unbiased and educated person would see that this statement by Obama is an almost exact copy of leading politicians and propaganda specialists of the Third Reich, including Adolph Hitler… In essence, Obama is using the exact same thing that Nazi bosses said about the German exceptionalism when they started the world war,” he added. The judge also said that in his view the exceptionalism concept had direct influence on the modern US concepts of military planning and these concepts see the main objective of all activities as reaching such degree of military might that the United States remains out of reach of other nations, on land, sea, in air and in space. According to Zorkin, the same applies to the US doctrines on development of mass media and electronic communications – the US authorities see their goal as establishing absolute global domination of their country in the global information space. This idea also constantly appears in Obama’s public speeches. “Obama says that Americans and the USA are an exceptional people and an exceptional state and thus they can pretend for much more than any other people or state. In other words, he follows the plot of James Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ dystopia and, while formally not rejecting the principle of equality of sovereign states and peoples, fixed by the UN Charter, he still declares that Americans and America are ‘more equal’ than any other country and the rest of the planet’s population,” RIA Novosti quoted the judge as saying. Zorkin also told his colleague at the forum that he considered such approach to be a blatant violation of international legal norms. Russian politicians and officials have repeatedly addressed the topic of American exceptionalism when talking on bilateral relations with the US and of international politics in general. In particular, in mid-2015 President Vladimir Putin said in his speech before the UN General Assembly that attempts to influence internal politics of sovereign nations should not be tolerated regardless of where they are taking place and who are making such attempts.

The export of so-called ‘democratic’ revolutions continues.” Putin said. “I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, ‘Do you realize now what you have done?’” he said. “But I am afraid the question will hang in the air, because policies based on self-confidence and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.” '],\n",

Peter Thiel is a globalist Bilderberger. He didn\\'t go after Gawker because he believes in free speech or nationalism https://t.co/Oq7u4vaGXj While saying he feels “it’s always important to exchange views with people no matter what their perspectives are,” he added the caveat that they “need to be finding ways to talk to people where not everything is completely transparent.” While the official agenda for the three-day event has been released, those opposed to it have aired their unease at the way in which over 120 of the most powerful politicians, bankers, and industry leaders meet to discuss the “problems in our society,\" since it’s not clear what \"secret\" deals have been cut and later inflicted on people around the world who aren’t on the invite list.

Just wow. https://t.co/q3Iq2qJcvK The irony of the statements weren\\'t missed by social media users, who were keen to note that Thiel sits on the board of directors at Facebook, a company renowned for its monitoring and monetization of its users’ data. Thiel defends secret Bilderberg talks, equating transparency and \"monitoring by society\" with communist oppression. https://t.co/na5dGSj62X The tech billionaire added: \"Often you have the best conversations in smaller groups where not everything is being monitored. That’s how you have very honest conversations and you can think better about the future.” This echoes similar comments from Thiel who, in 2009, wrote an essay entitled, \"The Education of a Libertarian” in which he admitted he “no longer believe[s] that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Thiel made headlines last month when he was outed as Hulk Hogan’s “secret” funding source for his lawsuit against Gawker, which caused the media organization to file for bankruptcy this week. READ MORE: Gawker files for bankruptcy after Hulk Hogan verdict, will be auctioned off His legal action was in response to a long-standing battle with the online publisher that started with their 2007 \"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\" Much like his views on “radical transparency,\" the lawsuit centered around privacy, free speech, and free press with Hogan ultimately winning $140 million in damages.

              "  \"Popular among fans, the 3-on-3 format for overtime periods was adopted by the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2015-2016 season, replacing the 4-on-4 format that the league had been using since the 1999-2000 season. Before that, overtime periods were played by the whole lines, with three forwards and two defensemen. The reduction of the number of skaters on the ice creates more open spaces, which allows players to get into the attacking zone easier and place more shots on the net, and significantly increases the chances to score. “The decision was unanimous,” said KHL President Dmitry Chernyshenko, TASS reported. “That format is used around the world, all around Europe. Hockey will become more entertaining.” The innovation will be also adopted by the Russian-based Junior Hockey League (MHL) and Women's Hockey League (WHL). The new format will, however, only be used in the regular season. “In the regular season overtimes will be played in the 3-on-3 format, in the playoffs in the 5-on-5 format,” the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's first vice-president, Roman Rotenberg, told TASS. \"],\n",

              "  \"The ongoing large-scale Anakonda-16 NATO military maneuvers in Poland, simulating the repulsion of “Russian aggression” against the country, are counterproductive, Deutsche Welle cited German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper, in an interview to be published Sunday. “Whoever believes that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring security is mistaken,” Steinmeier said ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw beginning July 8. “We are well-advised to not create pretexts to renew an old confrontation,” he emphasized. 'Deadly irony: US calls Russia ‘aggressive’ as NATO creeps eastward' (Op-Edge by Robert Bridge) https://t.co/1k8aZ9k7uI Rather than inflaming the situation further “through saber-rattling and warmongering,” there ought to be more space for dialogue and cooperation with Moscow, Steinmeier said. It would be “fatal to now narrow the focus to the military, and seek a remedy solely through a policy of deterrence,” German FM said, calling to give way to diplomacy instead of military posturing. Calling for dialogue and a diplomatic approach, Steinmeier also mentioned the necessity of maintaining military preparedness of NATO. The alliance should also consider the possibility to “renew discussions about the benefits of disarmament and arms control for security in Europe,” he said. The Anaconda drills have become NATO’s largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War, bringing to Poland over 31,000 troops from 24 NATO member states and “partner nations,” including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and others. Moscow has once again pointed out that augmentation of NATO military presence in Eastern Europe and Baltics is unjustified, stressing that Russia has no plans whatsoever to interfere with any country in the region. “I am convinced that every serious and honest politician is well aware that Russia will never invade any NATO member. We have no such plans,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated. The NATO summit in Warsaw is set to put “Russian threat” issue high on the agenda, as the gathering will be making the final decision on stationing additional NATO troops in Eastern Europe. More NATO troops deployed to Poland will be sending “a clear signal that an attack on Poland will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance,” the bloc’s Secretary General told reporters following his meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June. The statements made by NATO leadership put Russian diplomats in a position where they have to deny the obvious. “During the NATO secretary general’s recent visit to Poland, officials in this country [Poland] made statements suggesting that from now on Russia would know that any attack on Poland would mean an attack on NATO as a whole. This is completely absurd because they are discussing a non-existent problem. There are no plans for any attacks on Poland,” Russian envoy to NATO Aleksandr Grushko said in an interview with TV channel Russia-24. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said that NATO has “an absolutely slapdash attitude to our position on anything,” adding that it was the US that had unilaterally quit the missile defense treaty, which was initially signed to “provide strategic balance in the world.” NATO “needs a foreign enemy, otherwise what would be the reason for the existence of such an organization,” said the Russian leader. The conflict in Ukraine, caused by a bloody coup supported by the US and its European NATO allies, was forced on that country “to substantiate the very existence of the North Atlantic alliance,” the Russian president concluded. Putin assured his audience that he does not want to proceed to a new Cold War, as “no one wants it.”“However dramatic the logic of the development of international relations might seem on the outside, it’s not the logic of global confrontation,” he explained. \"],\n",

The two-day strike is the third since the New Year and was organized after talks between the government and junior doctors broke down, with Hunt deciding to impose the new contract without agreement. Previous strikes have focused on adjustments to pay and overtime working hours, which junior doctors said would leave them working longer hours for less pay, despite the government insisting that the new contract would result in a net pay rise of 13.5 percent.

Currently junior doctors net a premium rate for working on a Saturday, but new government plans would see Saturday treated as a regular working day, meaning doctors could lose out. Many Labour MPs joined picket lines on Wednesday morning, including Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and veteran MP Dennis Skinner. The Green Party has openly backed the strike, and its health spokesperson Larry Sanders called Hunt a “hypocrite.” “The hypocrisy of Jeremy Hunt announcing that he was imposing a contract on junior doctors exactly one year after he ‘called time on NHS bullying’ is astounding. Those junior doctors are essential to a functioning NHS and they will go on to become leaders of the service. They need to be treated with the respect that they deserve.” \"],\n",

              "  'Welcome to the circus of US political conventions',\n",
              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma-challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard-waving, holler-whooping people bused in from every town in the country. Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process. Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years. It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next. A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more. For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame. This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy-eyed patriot boasts. In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous. In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought. At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was “Lock her up! Lock her up!” with all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman’s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house. Trump promises to “Make America Great Again,” a sufficiently open-ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean. Given the billionaire’s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president. But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and is less than enthusiastic about NATO. This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm. Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin. She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, the gloating over the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America’s way be described as progressive. Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have some\\xa0interesting friends and supporters - Wall Street and George Soros prime among them – who aren’t exactly struggling to get by. Then, too, the sympathy she’s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill’s notorious crime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities. This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end. It is a two-term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question. How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years? LIVE on #Periscope: Watch Donald Trump speak at #RNCinCLEhttps://t.co/4u91jEcVo7 The question answers itself, as it does when applied to every US president and administration since the end of the Second World War, condemning each and every one with crimes against humanity committed on a mammoth scale. It is why the gulf between the Hollywood circus that is the Republican and Democrat National Conventions – with their nauseating celebration of US exceptionalism – and the reality for the millions who have suffered and will continue to suffer regardless of who enters the White House this year exposes US democracy as a sham. It is the best democracy that money can buy. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"Speaking during an exclusive interview with the Times of Israel, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum accused Netanyahu of being personally involved in a bureaucratic process which forced the company to fire its Palestinian employees. According to Birnbaum, it all began when SodaStream decided it needed more space, and opted to close its West Bank factory. The move did, however, follow a boycott campaign\\xa0against the company, in which critics accused it of making money on land “stolen” by Israel.  Though Birnbaum insists the move was made voluntarily, he says the Israeli government is arguing that SodaStream was forced to move due to the pressure from the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as fire the 500 Palestinians working there. But the company insists that despite claims from the Netanyahu government, it wanted to retain 350 of its 500 Palestinian employees to work at its new plant in the Negev. However, according to Birnbaum keeping such a high number of employees was impossible because the company was initially only granted permits for 120 of the Palestinian workers – a number which new conditions later reduced to 74. Since February, those remaining 74 employees have been barred from Israel, their permits retroactively canceled. “Apparently our 74 Palestinians represent a threat to [Netanyahu's] agenda,” Birnbaum said. The CEO says Netanyahu – who he refers to as the “prime minister of conflict” – is responsible for the outcome, adding that his office “intervened to stop the employment of our Palestinians so that Bibi [Netanyahu] can then point a finger at the BDS.” Birnbaum did not mince his words when speaking about the prime minister, accusing him of “systematically spreading hate within Israel between Jews and Arabs and between Orthodox and secular...” “It pains me to say that I believe this administration is nurturing the conflict in all its evil manifestations. They nurture the hate and the boycott and they nurture separatism,” he said. Unsurprisingly, the story coming from Netanyahu's office is starkly different. An official who asked to remain anonymous told the Times of Israel that Birnbaum had relocated his factory because of pressure from the BDS movement. He then noted that once SodaStream was out of the West Bank and inside Israel, it was required to comply with Israeli labor laws – meaning priority had to be given to Israeli workers. “SodaStream went from no quotas at Mishor Adumim, moved inside the Green Line, and was required to follow Israeli labor laws,” the official said. “So it had to lose its Palestinian workers.” The official went on to accuse Birnbaum of being ungrateful towards Netanyahu, as the PM had assisted Birnbaum with a grace period during the transition, arranging for two extensions for Palestinian workers. “The prime minister wanted to help make the transition more smooth. The lack of gratitude is appalling,” the official said. “The PM could have said, ‘We’re not helping him at all.’ Maybe we shouldn’t have helped him. To say it’s personal animus is despicable.” Meanwhile, Birnbaum says that Netanyahu would benefit from taking a leaf out of SodaStream's book, choosing to boost the number of Palestinians working in Israel rather than depriving them of opportunities. He stated that the biggest terrorist threat from Palestinians stems from those working in Israel without permission, stressing that such permits could “buy security.” \",\n",

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  ' Current EU rules allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content for three reasons: to comply with a member state’s laws, to manage levels of traffic across a network, or for security. The net neutrality rules are intended to prevent broadband operators from favoring specific sources of content such as commercial partners. Blocking porn falls into a gray area, as there is no clear legal framework in UK legislation. However, a revision to the guidelines issued by EU body Berec says blocked content, whether it is porn or ads, should be implemented by a customer on their device, rather than by the network. Frode Sorensen, co-chair of the Berec working group on net neutrality, refused to comment to the Guardian on specific cases or countries, but said the updated guidance made it clear there was no legal basis for using customer choice to justify blocking any content. ISPs Sky, BT and TalkTalk, and mobile operator O2 block access to adult sites following pressure from the government. Mobile operator Three recently ran an ad-blocking trial that required users to opt in. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson told the newspaper the rules still allowed for internet filters. “Family-friendly filters are permitted under the EU net neutrality regulation. The regulations give end-users the right to access information and content of their choice, and enabling/disabling filters exercises this choice.” A spokesperson for BT told the newspaper: “BT offers filtering at both network and device level dependent on the customer’s preferences. “The Berec guidelines are not binding and it’s for Ofcom to consider in its application and enforcement of EU regulations.” It a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom will monitor compliance with the new rules, and look into any complaints received. We will consider any potential breaches as they arise in accordance with our interpretation of the regulation, and drawing upon the Berec guidelines to inform our approach.” ',\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'Belgian investigators revealed at least five of the suspects behind the terror attacks on Paris and Brussels were receiving welfare benefits prior to the atrocities. The Wall Street Journal was one of the first media outlets that reported\\xa0on the story.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were receiving welfare benefits?\\xa0 Gerolf Annemans: People must know that Belgium is one of the most Islamised countries of Western Europe. My party especially concentrates on Jihadi fighters coming back from Syria and what they are still receiving after they’ve gone to Syria. Some of them received health care; we repaired their legs, etc. We discovered also that most of these Syrian fighters get allowances after proving that they are not able to get work. So this is a general phenomenon. Now we are very glad, because the Belgium press put this aside, never focused on it and never mentioned it. And we are very glad that The Wall Street Journal does this now and that we are joined now by the international press, because in Belgium the battle is very severe. The media and the regime are doing this because of what we call the Islamosocialism. All governments in Belgium are either left-wing or central-left wing, or at least are doing what they are doing now and what has been discovered now.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system. What should be done to prevent them from receiving welfare payments?\\xa0 GA: First of all, we have to choose other leaders, elect other leaders; leaders that have steel teeth, and can bite and can fight against Islamization of our society, and for instance blocking the social security. It is an enormous tragedy that we are in this paradox that the Belgium taxpayers paid for this Islamic attacks. We need other leaders, we need other leadership, we need to rethink our western democracies.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Do you think there could be more incidents like this?\\xa0 GA: Well, we have the tragedy of the asylum seekers, the millions that come now and that are all on our social security, because only a tiny minority gets work and helps our economy, or deals with our economy. So most of them end up in our social security system, which is, by the way, the reason why they come to Europe. They don’t stop where it is safe, or where there are no bullets shot anymore. They stop where there is social security. That is why they come to Germany, to Belgium, to Holland, and not to the other countries that they travel leaving Syria. This is a serious mistake to think that we have to change the people of Europe, that we have to exchange them with a new Islamic and mostly Muslim people. This is a failure, a mistake, politically, culturally, in every sense of the word.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Many of the attacks were carried out not by refugees, but by the people who were born or raised in the EU. How do you propose to deal with those kind of people?\\xa0 GA: These people, the people that are here, and are peaceful, and are not radicalizing, or are not promoting Muslim society on Western Europe soil, these people should get the message from our politicians, from our political regimes that they should adapt to our culture of our society. And for the rest we should close the borders that the EU opened widely. We must not let [Angela] Merkel decide our future. People and countries like ours should decide upon that themselves. The Merkel, the [Jean-Claude] Juncker, and the EU way of dealing with these problems is not the way we want it. The people should stand up and vote for leaders in their countries that promise to stop all these.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were getting welfare benefits?\\xa0 Jean Bricmont: I think that is a very bad argument. Of course, if the people knew that they were plotting terrorist attack then it was not a matter of cutting welfare, but putting them away in jail, or under surveillance, or something. The argument against welfare, which is used here, is very bad. It suggests that we should cut welfare, but to whom? To all the Muslim, to all the suspects, to everybody? The present government is already cutting welfare, and welfare has been cut and cut over the years. I think if anything it will probably increase the danger, because it would put more people in a precarious situation, which may lead them to violent action. I don’t think welfare is the problem at all. In fact fiscal fraud is much, much bigger than the welfare spending. So if welfare could prevent the terrorist attack it would be a very small amount of money. You might find it shocking that people on welfare kill other people, but what is shocking is not that they get welfare, but that they kill other people. If they had a job and were not receiving welfare, I would find it just as terrible and shocking.\\xa0\\xa0 It seems to me that The Wall Street Journal, in line with its neoliberal agenda, is trying to use this argument against welfare, which I think is a very bad argument. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is psychologically shocking, but stop and think about it. Stop welfare to whom?\\xa0 If we know that they are terrorists than it is not a matter of welfare, it is a matter of putting them under police control – so a very different business.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system.\\xa0 You would prefer then to ignore that fact, wouldn’t you?\\xa0 JB: Well, the question is: what did the police know? Obviously we should fight the Islamic State. I myself would be in favor of joining Russia in Syria and fighting them, other than doing what\\xa0 we do, which is inefficient bombing. That is a problem on the ground, it is not a problem of Belgian citizens, or even migrants in European countries…\\xa0 RT: How do you assess the level of security in the EU right now in the wake of a spate of horrific attacks, many of which were carried out by refugees?\\xa0 JB: It is pretty bad, but the point is that they are not refugees. Many of these people were citizens of the European countries. They grew up here. I don’t know every individual case, but many of the terrorists grew up here. They got very upset with… the trouble we created in the Middle East and the instability we created there.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Although the votes are still being counted in some states, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote with nearly 59.8 million votes, compared to Trump’s almost 59.6 million votes \\xa0– a lead of about 0.2 percentage points or more than 200,000 votes. Winning the popular vote is a bitter consolation prize for Clinton, as overall victory is based on the 538 members of the Electoral College, each of whom represent a state or the District of Columbia based on population. The number of electoral voters a state gets is equal to its representation in Congress, with a minimum of three (Delaware, DC, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) and a maximum of 55 (California). The winning candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. With Michigan (16) and New Hampshire (4) still outstanding, Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton only 218. Trump is set to become the second president in 16 years to win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote; George W. Bush was the first in the controversial 2000 election. However, it happened twice in 12 years in the 1800s: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Hayes suffered the biggest loss in the popular vote, losing by 3 percentage points to Southern Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Trump comes in second at 1.2 points. Both Bush and Harrison lost by less than a point to Vice President Al Gore and incumbent President Grover Cleveland respectively, according to Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidents. There is one other time that a president entered the White House without winning the popular vote, but that was in 1824, due to a four-way race that did not produce a winner in the Electoral College, forcing the House of Representatives to decide, in accordance with the 12th Amendment. The House elected John Quincy Adams as president. At that point in time, candidates did not run as a combined presidential and vice presidential ticket, and John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency outright. The situation that Trump finds himself in is thus relatively rare, but shifting demographics in the country mean that it could happen more often in the future, according to Vox. The US is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2055, there will not be a single racial or ethnic majority, the Pew Research Center found ahead of the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meeting. Most of those population gains by minorities are occurring in solidly Democratic and solidly Republican states, which means that they did nothing to shift the electoral map. While Trump made headway into all racial and ethnic groups compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, it was still whites who handed him his victory, with 58 percent voting for him, compared to 37 percent for Clinton. Whites made up 70 percent of voters on Tuesday. Trump gained 7 percentage points among black voters, 8 points among Hispanic and Latinos, 11 percent among Asians and 1 percent among other ethnic groups, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polling. However, that doesn’t mean he did well among those groups. The vast majority of black voters (88 percent) chose Clinton, as did 65 percent each of Hispanic/Latino and Asian voters, while 56 percent of people belonging to other ethnic groups voted for Clinton. Millennials ‒ in this case defined as those born after 1980 ‒ have likely replaced the baby boomers as the largest generation. Trump again made headway with this group, gaining 5 points over Romney, but lost the group overall. More than half (55 percent) voted for Clinton, while only 37 percent opted for Trump. It was voters age 45 and older ‒ the baby boomers and Generation X ‒ who gave him the victory, with 53 percent voting for Trump. So basically, Trump won because of older white people, according to @nytimes & @cnn analyses of exit polling pic.twitter.com/rkfXLWixau If millennials had been the only voters, it would have been a landslide victory for Clinton in the Electoral College. Instead, however, they were in the minority, making up only 44 percent of voters on Tuesday. This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision. pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869 There is one place that the popular vote does matter, however: third parties. If a third-party candidate receives 5 percent of the vote, then their party is eligible to receive federal grants from the Federal Election Commission in the 2020 general election. Unfortunately for Libertarian Gary Johnson (less than 4.1 million), Green Jill Stein (just over 1.2 million) and independent Evan McMullin (about 423,000), none of them reached the necessary milestone. If all their votes were to be combined, they would come to just under 5.7 million, or about half a million votes short. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"The yearly manned space flights, part of Russia’s moon exploration program, will include flyovers and landings on the lunar surface. In order to achieve these goals, Russia plans to use a new type of a manned spacecraft called the Federatsiya (Federation). Russian space rocket corporation Energia will start construction of the spacecraft and software development this summer, the company’s chief designer told journalists. The Federatsiya will be a new generation vessel to replace the currently used Soyuz spaceships. It is designed for transferring people and delivering cargo to the moon and the International Space Station (ISS). Its crew will be four to six cosmonauts. The spaceship is expected to be able to operate autonomously for up to 30 days. It can be deployed to the ISS for up to one year. The testing of the spacecraft is expected to start in 2021, with an unmanned flight launched from Russia’s new Vostochny spaceport in the Far Eastern Amur region. The first test will be followed by two more launches in 2023, including one manned flight. The Angara A5B heavy carrier rocket will be used for the launches, TASS reports. Earlier, it was reported that Federatsiya test flights will include four launches, two of which will be manned and one will involve a flyover of the moon. Energia Corporation has already unveiled another project designed for a potential lunar trip. The company presented draft plans for a new reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the ISS and the moon called the Ryvok (Charge of Breakthrough) at the Human Space Exploration international conference in Korolev, near Moscow, on May 26. The Ryvok spacecraft will be permanently based on the ISS – or its descendant – and will serve as the mid-way shuttle for delivering cargo and crews to the moon, the representatives of the company said at the conference, adding that Ryvok will be much more cost efficient compared to the Federatsiya spacecraft. The Energia Corporation and NASA are also discussing a project to create a joint space station orbiting the moon, which could be put into operation by the end of the next decade, Energia's representative Yuri Makushenko told journalists at the conference. The new space station will have accommodation and energy modules as well as nodes and spaceships, he added. The new station is expected to become a transport hub for maintenance, communications and navigation of the lunar missions and for un-manned missions to Mars and the asteroid belt between the Red Planet and Jupiter. \",\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Sunday’s general election Russia saw people vote for members of the lower house, the State Duma and several regional heads. With almost all the votes counted, the ruling United Russia party is likely to secure the majority of seats in the Duma. It's followed by the Russian Communist party (KPRF) and the Liberal Democrats (LDPR), who are neck and neck. Fair Russia has also made it to the lower house with about 6 percent of the votes. The result of the vote didn’t come as any surprise. Various polls and analysts predicted United Russia was going to remain the majority party. However, Western media criticized the election dubbing it “a show” and “a farce” even before it started. Yvan Blot, former member of the French and European Parliaments, says this election result reminded him of the French presidential elections when Charles de Gaulle “had 50 percent of the votes.” “It is the same now in Russia with United Russia, Putin’s party. What strikes me is that all political parties in the majority and in the opposition are patriotic. It is not the case in France, I must admit,” he told RT. Former French MP Blot, commenting on the matter said Western countries should mind their own election process. State Duma elections start in Russia https://t.co/bQvOEODkBO For instance, in France, the system “is less democratic than the Russian one,” he said. He referred to the way Russian lawmakers are elected to the Duma: half of the MPs are elected from single-mandate districts (one candidate per district), the other half - from party candidate lists on a proportional basis. “In France we have a more simple system: every candidate comes from a constituency. But constituencies were designed by the most powerful party some years ago. With the result of 1/3 of the votes the National Front has only two members of Parliament. Is that democratic? It is not democratic at all. It is the same for the extreme left. [It] has very few members of Parliament, but they have voices,” he said. “Besides, candidates in France are selected in general by little committees of oligarchs within political parties. We have no primaries, except now in the Republican Party Presidential election. But in general it is not a tradition to have primaries,” Blot said. Primaries had not been a common thing for Russia either until this year, when ahead of the September 18 parliamentary vote, United Russia held nationwide primaries. The third “big problem” in France, according to Blot, is that opinions of political leaders differ from those of voters. “For that reason people are very deceived by all political parties. In France the rate of trust for a political party is only 18 per cent of the people. I think we have no lesson to give to Russia about democracy. Russia is not perfect – perfection doesn’t exist in the world. But I think the system has much improved since some years and now it is more democratic than in France,” the former MP said. Adam Garrie, author at The Duran says the Western media painted the Russian vote “as a show” because they “don’t want to admit that the democracy in Russia is indeed one of the most vibrant and, more importantly, diverse in the free world”. “When you just listen to some of the many debates in the Duma, you’ve got a broader range of opinions than you’ve got in the British Parliament, in the US Congress, or most places in Europe,” he told RT. In recent years, the Russian government has introduced a number of changes to make elections more representative. For instance, the threshold for parties to get into parliament was lowered to 5 percent and a prominent human rights activist, Ella Pamfilova was appointed to head the Central Election Commission. Garrie explains Western media have an agenda, “and the agenda doesn’t rely on the facts”. “The fact of the matter is that the Russian government has gone out of its way to make this one of the most widespread free and fair elections possible from opening polling stations in some of the most remotest parts of the world – to videotaping all the polling stations to catch any possible irregularities when and as they happen. This factual truth isn’t something that seems to match the Western narrative – that says the Russian electoral system is somehow backwards or undemocratic. Perhaps they are ashamed that the Russian system is slightly more democratic and certainly more ideologically and personally diverse than a lot of place in the so-called West,” he said.\\xa0 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \",\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'According to an official notification from the national RTA SE media body, the suspension will come into force in 60 days. The channel will be excluded from free transmission, but will still remain in paid TV packages. The media governing body expressed its “gratitude” for a fruitful cooperation and the contribution of RT Spanish to the national satellite and digital broadcasts in a letter signed by RTA’s Maria Eugenia Martinez, who emphasized that current notification of suspension “does not prevent the conclusion of other future partnerships.” On June 7, a similar letter was sent to the pan-Latin American terrestrial and satellite television network TeleSUR TV, notifying that its broadcasting in Argentina would be suspended within 15 days. TeleSUR President Patricia Villegas denounced the move as “censorship” on the part of the right-wing Argentine president Mauricio Macri and his government. Both letters cited the “need to renew the program listings” of Argentina’s Experimental System of Digital Terrestrial Television and Satellite Television Systems as the reason for suspensions. Censura @mauriciomacri a @teleSURtv#NoNosCallarán#TeleSURConArgentinapic.twitter.com/Mxb3l9UfE9 “The official explanation has been that they need those channels presently occupied by the RT Spanish signal, and also the TeleSur Venezuela signal. The government is saying, officially, that they need those two frequency slots to transmit provincial channels, channels from Argentinian provinces, for example Tierra del Fuego which is way down in the South,” said international political analyst and RT contributor Adrian Salbuchi. “But that is hardly a credible explanation of any sort whatsoever.” READ MORE: RT and Venezuela TeleSUR journalists unite to provide fresh perspective on news “RT and also TeleSUR… definitely [have] a very alternative view on international politics, finance, economic treaties, for example like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so forth… regrettably, what we are seeing at least in Argentina is a case of censorship where the government does not want alternative viewpoint… to be heard by the Argentinian population,” Salbuchi added. OP-EGDE: ‘RT broadcast halt in Argentina is all-out psychological onslaught on Latin America’ “I think that part of this is an effort to deny the citizens of Argentina the opportunity to hear a plurality of voices about what is taking place in other countries in the region,” believes RT Spanish “Behind the News” host and attorney Eva Golinger. “This is a government that has just completed six months in office. It’s a really narrow timeframe, and yet they’ve already taken harsh measures… TeleSUR may have had a more critical voice towards the government, but this is a government that ran on a platform saying they were promoting wider democracy and more freedoms in Argentina. And now we are seeing that what they are actually doing is the opposite.” Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Upper House committee for foreign affairs, said that the main reason for RT’s suspension “is the shift in the power in Argentina” after pro-American Mauricio Macri became president in late 2015. According to the official, the move is one of the first signs of Argentina’s rapprochement with the US. “The US always and everywhere are trying to consistently monopolize the information realm and remove all other alternative sources of information. We know how concerned the US authorities are by the popularity of RT,” Kosachev stressed. The decision to launch RT’s Spanish-language channel as part of the Latin American country’s national television broadcast in 2014 was applauded by the presidents of Russia and Argentina. “Harsh information wars and the attempts of some countries to monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests have become a sign of modern times,”\\xa0President Vladimir Putin said at the time, stressing that “in these circumstances alternative sources of information are particularly in demand. RT is definitely one of them.” Former Argentinian leader\\xa0Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\\xa0also praised the initiative back in 2014 saying, “we are really glad to welcome RT Spanish in Television Digital Terrestre (TDA), which is available all over the country.”  ',\n",

A police helicopter was circling the area and a large number of officers were deployed to the scene. Over a dozen paramedics also arrived on site.

READ MORE:\\xa0Russia\\'s Svetlana Kuznetsova knocks Serena Williams out of Miami Open Kuznetsova said finishing Bacsinszky in two sets could well be decisive come this weekend’s clash. \"I am happy that I could hang in there and never let my hands down,” she said. \"I have not been feeling my best but I have been fighting every ball and just trying to run as much as I could. \"I was praying to finish it in two sets so I can have a little bit of time to rest.” Should Kuznetsova claim glory on Saturday it would be a welcome piece of news for Russian tennis following Maria Sharapova’s suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium. Azarenka represents a tough opponent, however, with the Belarusian making light work of second seed Angelique Kerber to make the final. The 13th seed lost to Kerber in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January, but claimed an impressive 6-2 7-5 victory on Thursday.

One fan says: \"Flight\\'s cancelled - they\\'ve rebooked us on Lufthansa.\" The other replies: \"Lufthansa? We\\'re flying with the Germans?!\" The scene switches to the plane, where the younger fan is sitting in front of a traditional Bavarian \\'oompah band\\'. A young fan in a Germany shirt brandishes four fingers towards the Englishman - in reference to the Germans’ four World Cup wins. But it all turns to be just a bad dream for the England fan, as he is later served a cold beer – although the young German fan continues to taunt him from the seat behind. England fans have generally enjoyed their journeys to Germany in recent years, having not lost there since 1987. Whether Lufthansa\\'s efforts reach the dizzy heights of other aviation/football-themed videos is open to debate, with Turkish Airlines\\' 2011 Manchester United commercial one of the best from the past few years. While Wayne Rooney thundering a volley on a plane at Bobby Charlton\\'s head is a thing of genius, undoubtedly the finest ever football commercial has to be Nike\\'s airport-based 1998 offering featuring one of the most talented Brazilian teams in history.

After the hearing the committee took a recess before delivering its verdict. CSKA Moscow and Finland midfielder Roman Eremenko gets two-year ban from UEFA after testing positive for cocaine. “The Finnish player has been suspended for two years from all competitions, following the positive result of a doping control test in competition undergone by the player after the UEFA Champions League group stage match between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and PFC CSKA Moskva played on 14 September 2016 in Germany,” the press release reads. After giving a positive sample for cocaine, but before being suspended, Eremenko played against Spurs in CL and in 3 Russian league games. “The analysis of the A sample revealed the presence of cocaine and its metabolites - a stimulant that is classified under the category of prohibited substances in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 2016 Prohibited List under class S6 - being prohibited in-competition. “The player was found guilty of being in breach of the UEFA Anti-Doping Regulations, Edition 2016.

It then extended the ban based on the UEFA verdict. Eremenko, who has won 73 caps for his national side, has the right to appeal the ruling. Earlier this month, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) gave Algerian forward Youcef Belaili a two-year ban on appeal for cocaine after throwing out a previous four-year sanction on procedural grounds.

              "  'GCHQ has recruited several thousand more people as the “task of tackling complex threats becomes more difficult and labor intensive,” the Times\\xa0reported. The majority of the thousands of extra staff hired as contractors are thought to come from the private sector, according to the newspaper. “They are all security-vetted and sworn to secrecy.” David Davis, a Conservative Party MP, told the Times that secrecy surrounding GCHQ’s numerical strength was “a bad opening chapter to this new era of transparency.” A spokesperson for GCHQ declined to give exact numbers of those employed in the agency and its partners. \"The total number of people working for or with GCHQ constantly fluctuates due to the complex challenges we face and the threats we aim to counter,\" the spokesperson told IBTimes UK, adding: \"In a complex organization like GCHQ, as you would expect, our core mission is supported by a range of partners including industry and the military.” GCHQ employed 5,683 full-time staff in August 2014, according\\xa0to official figures from the UK parliament\\'s Intelligence and Security Committee. MI5 had 3,926 and MI6 2,430 employees.\\xa0 “We should be asking why are these numbers so secret? And who is paying for all these people? Is Britain paying or is GCHQ doing things for other people who are paying?” Mr Davis told the Times. In November, UK Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hire over 1,900 new spies, citing growing security concerns. \"We need to do more to ensure our agencies have the resources and the information they need to prevent and disrupt plots against this country at every stage. So in next week\\'s strategic defense and security review, we will make a major additional investment in our world class intelligence agencies. This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counter-terrorism experts in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,\" Cameron said. \"We will also more than double our spending on aviation security around the world with more experts overseas working side by side with host nations in the most vulnerable locations. We also need to do more to make sure the powers we give our security services keep pace with changes in technology,\" he added. Last month, the UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (a judicial body independent of the British government, which hears complaints about surveillance by public bodies) was told that GCHQ is “persistent” in its hacking of phones and computers across the globe. GCHQ activities include using the microphones and cameras built into devices to spy on people, locate their position and access documents and pictures, lawyers representing civil liberties group Privacy International told the tribunal. The intelligence agency cited the heightened threat of terrorism to justify its actions, saying: “Over the last year the threat to the UK from international terrorism has continued to increase,” James Eadie, representing GCHQ, said in his written arguments to the tribunal. The case was brought in light of revelations by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who exposed the extent of GCHQ surveillance.  ',\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The UN special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said he is “shocked and appalled by the high number of rockets indiscriminately launched by armed opposition groups on civilian areas of western Aleppo in the last 48 hours.” “Those who argue that this is meant to relieve the siege of eastern Aleppo should be reminded that nothing justifies the use of disproportionate, indiscriminate including heavy weapons on civilian areas,” Staffan de Mistura said. The actions \"could amount to war crimes,\" he warned. Government-held West Aleppo has been under constant fire from the rebel-controlled East for several weeks now with many civilians, including children, falling victim to the attacks. RT: Do you think there will be, at some point, an official investigation into human rights violations committed by rebel groups as they continue with their attacks on western Aleppo? Jim Jatras: Well, there certainly should be and the question whether they will be is very difficult to answer because, remember, these are groups supported by the US and other Western countries and by our allies in the region - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so forth. Despite the fact that these are terrorist groups, that they are Al-Qaeda and their various allies, and they are very reluctant to put a spotlight on the kind of people that we’re supporting in this region. Let’s remember, a couple of months ago the Al-Zinki group was alleged of using chlorine gas. And the State Department spokesman was asked, ‘if we were shown [that] they used chlorine gas, would we drop our support for them?’ And he refused to answer. So I’m afraid we’re going to see a roadblock put in by Western governments to avoid that kind of investigation. RT: If they continue to commit what may amount to war crimes, could the rebels lose Western support? In terms of public opinion, is there any chance we\\'ll start seeing a shift in attitude toward armed opposition groups in Syria? JJ: It is certainly out of the bag for people who watch RT and who tune into alternative media. But as far as the American mainstream media goes, it is not out of the bag at all. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups. I would be very interested to see in the very next couple of days, will the American and other Western European mainstream media report this and pin the blame where it belongs - on these terrorists and on the governments that are supporting them. RT: Are the attacks and potential war crimes receiving sufficient coverage to sway public opinion? JJ: Absolutely not. These attacks are not new, these attacks against West Aleppo have been going on continuously and they receive zero reporting in the Western media. I monitor the American media pretty closely, and look at the double standards on how they report on say the offensive against Mosul versus the offensive against East Aleppo. They are night and day difference and I have not heard any reports of terrorist attacks on West Aleppo in the American media. RT: In their latest assault, it appears the rebels used chlorine gas. Where are they likely to have acquired such weapons or the materials required for their assembly? JJ: We’ve had a couple of instances with sarin, for example. There have been allegations in the past that this has been done inside Turkey. I am not in a position to verify that, but given that that’s the main route of the supply for the terrorists, that would be a reasonable speculation to start with. Moderate radical groups are like a Trojan Horse that Western countries and the Gulf States put inside Syria, says Dr. Said Sadiq, professor of political sociology at the American University of Cairo. RT: Staffan de Mistura has condemned the rebel’s actions in Aleppo. Will Western politicians and media now shift their attention to the atrocities the rebels are committing? Dr. Said Sadiq: Despite the fact that not Mistura alone but also the UN Secretary General also condemned what is happening, but all Western media attention is going now to the battle of Mosul in Iraq and what is happening in Aleppo is being sidestepped and played down in international media… RT: Today there was a chemical gas attack in western Aleppo. Will the West reassess its support for these so called moderate groups if it is confirmed the rebels conducted it? SS: We have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf States invested in those moderate radical groups and so they cannot abandon them. They are like the Trojan Horse that they had put inside the Syrian domestic situation. They cannot pull out now and say: “Okay, we discovered that we were wrong, let’s get out and leave them.” They have invested in them and they will still use them in bargaining in the future of Syria. So, if there are any future negotiations on the fate of Syria, those people, these cards of radicals and moderates will be used on the negotiating table. I don’t think that they will get rid of them soon. Secondly, how did they get all those chemical weapons? The Gulf States provide weapons but they don’t have chemicals. So, most likely the chemical weapons had come from a NATO country. Because these are the only countries that have such kind of weapons. How did these chemical weapons come to the Syrian rebels? You will have the usual suspect –Turkey. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups.\\xa0 RT: The UK plans to launch a new program to train rebels and supply them with weapons. Last year a similar program was a complete failure and ended up with the rebels fighting alongside ISIS and Al-Nusra. Will the same happen again? SS: Six years of wasted resources and money to destroy Syria and they failed. The objective that was declared: “We will topple the Assad regime.” Six years and nothing happened. Do you think that one more year or more investment will tip the iceberg and change what we have seen? I doubt it. I think it was wasted money and they had one strategic aim: They don’t want the gas coming from Qatar to cross Syria to Europe and also to destroy the Syrian society, not the Syrian regime, Syrian society, the Syrian army, Syrian territorial integrity.

              "  '“For us this is a very sensitive topic – today our Western partners start discussions about additional deployment of troops to countries that are our neighbors,” RIA Novosti quoted Vladimir Makey as saying on Monday, after the talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “This causes our concern, we see this as a potential challenge to our nation.” READ MORE: ‘Ludicrous to believe NATO missile defense in Eastern Europe not targeting Russia’ Makey also said that Russia and Belarus would jointly develop “adequate reactive measures” both to additional deployment of conventional troops to Eastern Europe and putting elements of the US global missile defense system in the proximity to Russian and Belarus borders. The minister reminded the press that his country and the Russian Federation have formed a Union State and continue to develop close ties in the military sphere. Putting additional troop in the European region only added up to tensions and damaged the universal security, he said. Last week NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg took part in the inauguration ceremony of the US Aegis Ashore anti-missile station in Romania. Stoltenberg mentioned in his speech that the facility does not pose any threat to the Russian Federation, but this statement was immediately questioned by Russian politicians and officials. “We have been saying right from when this story started that our experts are convinced that the deployment of the ABM system poses a certain threat to the Russian Federation,” President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"Measures are being taken to ensure the necessary level of security for Russia. The president himself, let me remind you, has repeatedly asked who the system will work against [if not Russia].” READ MORE: ‘Certainly it’s a threat’: Moscow rejects NATO claims ABM site safe for Russia The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\\'s Department for Proliferation and Arms Control Issues, Mikhail Ulyanov, told reporters last week that the move had an adverse effect on strategic stability, adding that the direct interests of Russia’s security are affected by this event. He added that by launching the Romanian base the United States violated the 1987 INF treaty under which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed their respective countries up to obligations “not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500km to 5,500km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.” Also last week the US commenced the construction of an ABM site in Poland, due to be ready by late 2018.

              "  'Police didn’t properly classify crimes involving rape up to 2014, with about 700 cases containing allegations of sexual abuse remaining unattributed to this category every year. The average number of rape cases annually registered by police was nearly half that figure at 395, according to the Justice Ministry’s investigation, Metroxpress\\xa0reports. The majority of unrecorded rape incidents ended up as cases with inconclusive evidence, as there were doubts whether rapes had been committed. This approach to statistics was dropped in November 2015, but still an unknown number of cases are not reflected in the data.The Justice Ministry says the real number of rape cases totals an average of 1,100 a year. “It is a huge number, but it doesn’t surprise me that the actual number is higher than the official one,” Hanne Baden Nielsen, director of the Center for Sexual Assault, said describing the revelations as “astonishing.” Her comments were reported by The Local. Danish nightspots bar migrants by introducing ‘language controls’ https://t.co/uvOYkU1EZCpic.twitter.com/Av5QOhG64I Pernille Skipper, a Danish MP, blamed the police for mishandling sexual abuse cases. “Unfortunately, this reflects what we are hearing from women that tell us that the police are sending them home,” she said. However, Soren Pind, Denmark`s Justice Minister, denied that the incorrect data was a result of an intentional cover-up and stressed the need to improve the accuracy of statistics. “I don’t think anyone in the system actually wanted to hide these things,” she told Metroexpress, adding that the authorities intend to monitor the police’s actions in this area more closely. “We are bringing in a monitoring of this area. If any case is suspended, reasons must be given, so now we will get a useful statistic.” On Wednesday, a Danish teenage girl was sexually assaulted by an English-speaking man in the center of the small town of Sonderborg . The attacker knocked her down and was about to assault her when she used pepper spray to defend herself, forcing him to flee the scene. However, police charged her with possessing a weapon, saying it is illegal to carry and use pepper sprays, according to reports in local media. Earlier, it was reported that women were subject to harassment by asylum seekers in at least three Danish cities. Several incidents occurred in the town of Thisted, where a refugee camp for 365 asylum seekers is located. Cases of sexual abuse were also registered in the Danish cities of Sonderborg and Hardeslev, where several local nightspots owners imposed “language controls” requiring visitors to prove their ability to speak Danish, German or French, following complaints from women. Since 551 women reported being sexual harassed on New Year’s Eve in the German city of Cologne, allegedly committed by groups of migrants of North African origin, the problem of sexually-related violence in Europe has been in the media spotlight.

              "  'Australian archaeologist Damian Evans’ findings, which are due to be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science on Monday, detail the scale of the discovery surrounding the temples of Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world.\\xa0 Phnom Hub in site Kulen National park 2016 06 08 pic.twitter.com/SsAxtroFtv Cutting-edge laser technology, known as Lidar, which is fired from a helicopter into the ground, penetrating through forests, was used to produce detailed imagery of the Earth’s surface. It revealed a network of ancient cities between 900 and 1,400 years old, with some as big as Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh, according to The Guardian. The data, captured in 2015, suggests the Khmer empire would have been the largest in the world during the 12 century.\\xa0 Evans first carried out a light detection and ranging study in 2012, and the project received funding from the European Research Council as a result.\\xa0 The 2012 study revealed connections between Angkor Wat and other temple cities like Koh Ker. It also confirmed the presence of Mahendraparvata, a city beneath Mount Kulen, and the more recent survey revealed the scale of that city. Water systems were also discovered, which shows the technology was used hundreds of years earlier than previously believed.\\xa0 David Chandler, emeritus professor at Monash University in Melbourne and one of the leading experts on Cambodian history, described the findings as “game-changing,” saying it had succeeded in “putting hundreds of nameless, ordinary, Khmer-speaking people back into Cambodia’s past.” The new discovery also debunks a previously held theory that suggested the Khmer had fled from the area when the Thais invaded in the 15th Century. “That didn’t happen, there are no cities [revealed by the aerial survey] that they fled to. It calls into question the whole notion of an Angkorian collapse,” Evans said. A sample of the kind of imagery now coming online from the 2015 Cambodian lidar campaign: https://t.co/AxwidYqnCGpic.twitter.com/ZNYUB9dK1B South-East Asia’s leading archaeologist, Charles Higham, a professor at Dunedin’s University of Otago in New Zealand, summed up the discovery, “Personally, it is wonderful to be alive as these new discoveries are being made. Emotionally, I am stunned. Intellectually, I am stimulated.” Although the collected data will take years to fully analyze, the discovery is sure to reveal more about the Khmer empire and provide a boost to Cambodian tourism. Angkor Wat is Cambodia’s main tourist attraction, but the vast archaeological park located in Siem Reap has experienced a stagnation in ticket sales in 2016, the Phnom Penh Post reports.\\xa0 ',\n",

Experts say the Chinese are using the digital currency as a way to circumvent capital controls. “There is a premium in bitcoin pricing in China as a hedge against the yuan,\" Jack Liu, the Hong Kong-based chief strategy officer at OKCoin told Bloomberg. “Strength is likely to carry into year-end.\" China accounts for about 90 percent of all bitcoin trading on exchanges. The country has strict capital controls, which makes it difficult for the Chinese to convert the yuan into foreign currency, and limits the amount of cash investors can move abroad.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  '“The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,” Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, adding that it was done deliberately and on purpose. “This idea was planted into the US public consciousness… with only one goal… to protect the interests of the Democratic candidate in her competition with the candidate of the Republicans, in this case – with Mr. Trump,” the Russian president stressed. The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. “The ‘Russian card’ has been used to demonize one particular candidate – to tie him with Russia, which is not particularly popular in the US at the moment and therefore to diminish his prospects,” former British diplomat Alastair Crooke told RT. He also warned that the deliberate “demonization of Russia in every aspect” used as a political tool during the US presidential campaign will have “a substantive long-term effect on the relations, whoever will be president.” “It will make it very, very difficult for [the future US president] to start a new relationship with the Russian president afterwards,” Crooke stressed. His words were partly echoed by writer John Wight, who told RT that accusing Russia of meddling with the US election process on behalf of Donald Trump is “reckless and very dangerous because whoever will be the next president, he or she is going to deal with Russia.” At the same time, Wight stressed, “it is in the interest of the US people as well as of the people of the whole world that the US reset relations with Russia.” Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. “He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin.

              "  'The official entry was made Saturday, bringing to a close, at least partially, Beijing’s years-long struggle for international acceptance on the sort of level enjoyed by the US dollar. The currency now joins the big four: the US dollar, the euro, the yen, and the British pound. The decision means the Chinese yuan will now be used as one of the International Monetary Fund’s lending currencies in times of emergency economic bailouts. This sort of internationalization is in line with China’s wish for increased legitimacy of its currency. The move is also evidence of China’s growing role as a power to challenge the global economic dominance of the United States. The limitations China places on its own markets, however, have themselves been to blame for this delayed outcome. “It’s an irreversible path towards opening up, integrating into the global economy and playing the economic game by the rules,” proclaimed IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. READ MORE: Putin’s gift to Xi causes Russian ice cream craze in China Her assurance comes as critics say the move is no more than symbolic. Many of them accuse Beijing of exchange rate manipulations and cross-border capital movements. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said China is still “quite a ways” away from the status of a true global reserve currency. Nevertheless, the IMF said it recognizes the “enormous” changes made over the past decade to bring yuan out into the open. On Friday, the IMF fixed the relative amounts of the five main currencies in its basket for five years, based on the exchange rate of each one over the last three months. ',\n",

              "  'business',\n",
              "  'The new delivery method for the freshest possible produce is being pioneered by\\xa0INFARM which is currently testing its live herb gardens at METRO stores in Berlin. The people behind the project say these are the first indoor farming installations of their kind, placed directly in supermarkets. \"Imagine a future where cities become self-sufficient in their food production, where autonomous farms grow fresh premium produce at affordable prices, eliminating waste and environmental impact,\" INFARM says. The farms look like a tiny greenhouse inside the store where shoppers can pick their own freshly harvested salad greens and herbs right from the growing plants. The advantages of the indoor micro-farms are lower transport costs and associated emissions. They use less water, energy and space than conventional farms and horizontal greenhouses. The vertical greenhouses currently grow only herbs and salad greens but the company says they can be reconfigured to growing other crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and others. INFARM’s Berlin pilot program with vertical mini-farms will end in six months after which the company plans expanding into other supermarket locations. It is also considering putting similar modules into restaurants and hotels which want to offer something unique to their clients and guests. INFARM began several years ago as an indoor urban farming startup with an origami-inspired micro-garden project. Today, the company says \"Our farms are a perfect synergy between hardware and software, creating far greater production efficiency than any other technology in the market.\" ',\n",

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  'WADA says athletes who are found to have less than 1 mcg of meldonium in doping tests carried out before March 1, 2016, could be allowed to compete again. Tennis player Maria Sharapova and swimmer Yulia Efimova were two of around 40 Russian athletes who failed drug tests for meldonium.\\xa0 “If the anti-doping organization finds that the athlete could not reasonably have known or suspected that the substance would still be present in his/her body on or after 1 January 2016, then a finding of no fault or negligence may be made,” a press release\\xa0from WADA stated.\\xa0 However, WADA said this was not an “amnesty,” rather it was an acceptance that organizations should take occurrences on a case by case basis. \"In no way does this serve as an \\'amnesty\\' for athletes that are asserted to have committed an anti-doping rule violation,\" WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told AP in an email. \"Rather, it serves as guidance for how anti-doping organizations should assess the particular circumstances of each individual case under their jurisdiction.\"\\xa0 In the statement, WADA admitted that more tests need to be carried out to find out how long meldonium can remain in the blood stream, a point which has been argued by Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko.\\xa0 “In the case of meldonium, there is currently a lack of clear scientific information on excretion times. For this reason, a hearing panel might justifiably find (unless there is specific evidence to the contrary) that an athlete who has established, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she ingested meldonium before 1 January 2016, could not reasonably have known or suspected the meldonium would still be present in his or her body on or after 1 January 2016. In these circumstances, WADA considers there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,” the statement continued.\\xa0 WADA can confirm there have been 172 Adverse Analytical Findings (positives) for Meldonium since it was banned on 1st January 2016 #WADA Athletes around the world were told meldonium was to be added to WADA’s list of banned substances in September 2015, while the ban came into effect on January 1, 2016.\\xa0 One of those who is set to gain from WADA’s decision is Sharapova. She said she had been taking meldonium for more than a decade because of health problems and was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in March after announcing she had failed a test at the Australian Open in Melbourne. However, the Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev said Sharapova’s ban could be addressed in a meeting with ITF head David Haggerty later this month. “The situation with Sharapova could be resolved after April 21 when we meet with the head of the international federation. After that all should be become clear. It is too early to talk about Sharapova competing at the Olympic Games,” TASS quoted Tarpishchev as saying, as cited by Reuters. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was happy that WADA had been flexible regarding meldonium in a statement on its website, as cited by TASS.\\xa0 “The Russian Sports Ministry supports and welcomes the decision made by WADA because it has showed a willingness to understand the situation, rather than stick to the rulebook. They were ready to study how long it would take for meldonium to be eliminated from the body of an athlete. WADA has sent recommendations to all the anti-doping organizations, which will allow them to make fair decisions based on the actual guilt of an athlete. In doing so, WADA has demonstrated impartiality and being objective in the fight against doping.”\\xa0 The five-time speed skating world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov and the 2014 Olympic short track gold medalist Semen Elistratov are two athletes who are set to benefit from WADA’s ruling, and the president of the Russian Speed Skating Union Aleksey Kravtsov told R-Sport that the pair should be allowed to compete again.\\xa0 “These sportsmen should be allowed to fall under the amnesty due to the amount found in their doping tests. They were not guilty, as we had been saying earlier. This is of course good news, but there is still a bit of a cloud hanging over all of this,” he said. ',\n",

If a foreign-based hosting company refuses to remove the content after receiving the request to do so by Russian authorities, its whole address is blocked in Russia.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  ' From Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, this Sunday, October 9 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, the major political party nominees for president face off for the second time. There will be a first time face-off as well, with undecided voters challenging the candidates on the issues. Again organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, this event will differ in several ways from the first debate a worldwide audience witnessed less than two weeks ago. Not only will the audience, chosen by the Gallup Organization, be asking half of all the questions, but there will be two moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News, instead of just one to handle the remainder. READ MORE: Top GOPers urge Trump to quit race amid tape scandal  Like the previous debate, this one will run for 90 minutes without any breaks. It will be aired on all the top networks except for NBC, which will be presenting NFL football, a serious competitor for viewers. As of Friday, the Real Clear Politics average of national election polls dated back to September 26 shows Clinton leading Trump by four-and-a-half points, 48.3 to 43.8 percent. And no, the third-party presidential candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein, did not improve their numbers to the level the debate commission requires for a spot in the debate. In polls released Friday from Quinnipiac and Rasmussen, Johnson was at 6 and 7 percent, while Dr. Stein garnered 3 and 2 percent, respectively. READ MORE: ‘I’m kind of far removed’: Clinton admits estrangement from middle class in Wall Street paid speech However, since Friday both candidates have been marred with separate scandals:\\xa0 Hillary\\'s leaked\\xa0Wall St. speech in which she claimed her and Bill\\'s \"fortunes\" allowed them to \"enjoy\" a lifestyle \"far removed\" from the middle class, and Trump\\'s 2005 hot mic \"Grab them by the p***y\" bombshell\\xa0could have a significant impact on poll numbers. This unpredictable election cycle continues to heat up, and the rules of the campaign trail are still being rewritten. Sometimes whole new roads to the White House come under construction without warning. One example is the state of North Dakota, long considered a safe haven for Republican presidential candidates. That red state, however, seems to be veering toward battleground status, as RT\\'s Ed Schultz hosted a political town hall in Fargo on Thursday night. The candidates are expected to address some of the most important issues facing America, such as climate change, gun control and social security, but don\\'t be surprised if Trump\\'s stance on women (i.e. hot mic) and Clinton\\'s never-ending\\xa0email debacle\\xa0are brought up too.\\xa0 “I hope that unlike the first debate, there\\'s actually real discussion over things Americans care about,” Ryan Girdusky of RedAlertPolitics.com told RT on Friday. But he isn’t holding his breath. “I think Trump is going to be a lot more of an attack dog. I think there\\'s going to be a lot more training under [vice presidential running mate] Mike Pence and consultation under [campaign manager] Kellyanne [Conway].” “And I think what Hillary is going to do is try to stick to the Clinton playbook of make Trump go down a rabbit hole,” Girdusky added. “Talk about his taxes, talk about his affairs, his relationships, talk about his money, talk about his hair, who knows, but get him away from the issues.” READ MORE: \\'Clinton campaign blames Russian hackers as Assange promises more leaks\\' Whatever happens Sunday night, it will determine how much momentum each candidate has with the homestretch in sight. The election will be just four weeks away, with the final debate taking place Wednesday, October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. According\\xa0to a Politico report,\\xa0Clinton is by far best positioned to steer the direction of the final days of the presidential race. Her campaign and affiliated accounts have $150 million on hand as of early October, in addition to $80 million already set aside for TV ads as well as more money for direct voter outreach. The report calculates the Clinton camp can afford to spend almost $5 million every single day ahead of November 8, and that does not count the Democratic National Committee coffers of around $11.5 million, from September reports, or the Priorities USA Action Super PAC, which began September with $40 million. The real estate tycoon, however, reported just $38 million at the start of September, compared to the Republican National Committee with $40.5 million, Politico reported. Other committees supporting Trump have not reported their totals since July. ',\n",

              "  'UPDATE: Baton Rouge shooter identified as former marine, reportedly ex-Nation of Islam member The attack was a lone-wolf incident, Colonel Mike Edmondson, the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police said at the press conference following the incident, according to Reuters. The active shooter situation declared in Baton Rouge on Sunday has come to an end, the gunman is dead, he added. \"We do not have an active shooter scenario in Baton Rouge,\" Edmonson said. Louisiana authorities will hold another press conference regarding the Baton Rouge shootings at 1pm CDT (1800 GMT) on Monday, Reuters reported. According to earlier reports, police believed there could have been at least two more suspects on the loose. Three officers out of five transported to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital have died from their injuries. Two others remain in hospital, with one being in fair condition and the other in a critical state, according to WAFB and Reuters.\\xa0The condition of the third policeman transported to the hospital remains unknown. The Baton Rouge police department reportedly used\\xa0a robot to check the area for explosive devices.\\xa0 “We do know, and do believe there are more than one suspect. That’s why we’re alerting the community. We sending in the robot to see if there are any explosives in the area or any explosives on him,” said Corporal L’Jean McKneely, WAFB reported. Two of the officers killed were from the Baton Rouge police, and the third was an East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s deputy, Baton Rouge Chief Administrative Officer William Daniel said earlier, as cited by The Advocate. The shooting took place at the B-Quik convenience store at a gas station, Baton Rouge police said, according to AP. The body of the suspect was found outside the store, at the door of a nearby fitness club. The city was\\xa0on high alert following the incident. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Casey Rayborn Hicks said earlier\\xa0that one gunman had been killed, and\\xa0police believed two more shooters may have been at large. WAFB said\\xa0that the shootout began in the early hours of Sunday morning on Airline Highway near Old Hammond Highway in Baton Rouge, less than one mile from police headquarters.\\xa0 Police reportedly have no clear picture on what started the shooting, but it seems there was a running gun fight in the area of the shopping center and convenience store. They were first notified of the incident at about 8:45 a.m. Sunday. Baton Rouge police responded to a call reporting a “suspicious person walking down Airline Highway with an assault rifle,”\\xa0a CNN source said, adding that the person opened fire as soon as the police squad arrived. According to a witness, there were at least 25-30 gunshots heard before police arrived, WAFB reported. Police officers were probably not the initial target, another witness said. \"This was not a come at police shooting.

The attack follows the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old black man, Alton Sterling, by two white police officers in Baton Rouge earlier in July. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake responded to a call that a man was allegedly using a gun to threaten another man outside a convenience store. Following the arrival of the police, Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point-blank range. The two officers, who are both currently suspended, claimed Sterling reached for a gun before being shot at by law enforcers. In a video recording of the incident, one of the officers, presumably Salamoni, shouted “He’s got a gun! Gun!” prompting his partner to pull out his service pistol and fire several shots. The US Department of Justice is leading a criminal investigation into the case, joined by the FBI and state police of Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Baton Rouge Police Department over the response to the protests that followed. “The lawsuit alleges that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to disperse protesters who were gathered peacefully to speak out against the police killing of Alton Sterling,” the ACLU said in a statement. The shooting led to massive protests against police violence in the US. One of the demonstrations spilled into yet more bloodshed. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 while guarding a rally against excessive use of force by police. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Micah Johnson, used a sniper rifle while targeting officers in what was reported to be a revenge attack for police killings of black people. \"We\\'re convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement – make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement\\'s efforts to punish people of color,\" Dallas Police Chief David said following the incident. Following a standoff with law enforcers Johnson was shot dead. He had served as a reservist in the army until April 2015 and was also deployed to Afghanistan from November 2003 to July 2014. Officials noted that they did not believe the man was part of a terrorist organization and that the assault was a lone-wolf attack. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  ' “This is political rhetoric that does not have great significance and does not take into account the real situation in Syria,” Putin told French TV channel TF1 during an interview in the central Russian city of Kovrov, when asked about the accusations that have been leveled by Francois Hollande, UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, and the Obama administration. Putin then accused the West of destabilizing the region – citing the Arab Spring in 2011 as a key flashpoint for tensions that still dominate the Muslim world. “I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries,” said Putin. “Remember how everyone rushed to support the Arab Spring? Where is that optimism now? How did it all end? Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our western partners’ forces?” Putin linked the volatility in the region to the recent spate of large-scale terrorist attacks in the West, which have either been planned or inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have thrived in the chaos. “[Before the Arab Spring] these Middle Eastern countries were not examples of democracies as we understand the word today, and there probably was a need and possibility to influence these societies’ organization, the state organization, and the nature of these regimes,” said Putin, who was attending a festival dedicated to Sambo, a Russian combat sport. “But whatever the case, these states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d’Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.” Putin also detailed his version of the breakdown of the long-negotiated joint operation between Washington and Moscow in Syria, claiming the key turning point was the September 16 US-led coalition strike on a Syrian army unit, which the Pentagon maintains was accident. “Our American colleagues told us that this airstrike was made in error. This error cost the lives of 80 people and, also just coincidence, perhaps, ISIS took the offensive immediately afterwards. At the same time, lower down the ranks, at the operations level, one of the American military service personnel said quite frankly that they spent several days preparing this strike. How could they make an error if they were several days in preparation?” said Putin. “This is how our ceasefire agreement ended up broken. Who broke the agreement? Was it us? No.” Several western powers have since blamed Russia for what they claim was a retaliatory strike on a UN convoy on September 20. Washington has now broken off any bilateral talks with Moscow over Syria. But Putin says that Russia is still open to helping resolve what the UN has termed the worst humanitarian crisis since the war – which has likely killed over 400,000 people – began five years ago. “It has been proposed that our armed units, Russian military personnel, be deployed on the road to ensure transit safety [for aid convoys to Aleppo]. The Russian military, who are courageous and decisive people, have said they would do it,” said Putin, who said that the initiative, which had not previously been made public, was an “exotic proposal.” “But I told them that this could only be done jointly with the US, and ordered them to make the proposal. We have proposed this, and they [the Americans] promptly refused. They do not want to deploy their troops there, but they also do not want to pull back opposition groups – who are, in fact, terrorists. What can we do in this situation?” Despite the downbeat tone of the interview, Putin insisted he was still “optimistic” about a diplomatic solution in Syria, and claimed that the offer to “reschedule” next week’s visit to France, which was canceled following a diplomatic snub by Francois Hollande, was genuine. “This is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo. But we are always open, of course, to any consultations and dialogue on this matter,” said Putin. WATCH MORE:  ',\n",

I think that special services from across the ocean are dealing with these issues, destabilizing the situation in these countries,” the deputy chair of the State Duma Committee for Eurasian Integration and Commonwealth of Independent States, Kazbek Taisayev, told Life news portal.The MP said that Western nations were not interested in a calm situation near Russian borders and took steps to prevent such developments. “As soon as we start a normal dialogue with our neighbors, something immediately happens in these countries,” he said. “We need to unite our efforts, I think that we have enough political will to render mutual help to poor nations,” Taisayev stated. The comment came shortly after a group of radical nationalists stormed and captured a police station in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan, killing one policeman and taking several more hostage. The attackers demanded the release of Armenian opposition figure Jirayr Sefilyan, who was detained last month after authorities reportedly uncovered a plot to seize several buildings and telecommunication facilities in Yerevan.

A large group of military officers attempted to seize power, displacing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, their plans were thwarted by police and thousands of ordinary people who took to the streets of Ankara and Istanbul. According to Turkish authorities 246 government supporters and at least 24 coup plotters were killed during the conflict.

From a further 265 tests conducted recently, the IOC has announced that 23 competitors from six countries have failed, with the focus on athletes that could potentially be set to compete in Brazil. IOC President Thomas Bach used this latest evidence of doping as a way to show that the organization is committed to stamping out illegal substance usage in the sport. \"These re-analyses show, once again, our determination in the fight against doping,\" he said. \"We want to keep the dopers away from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. “This is why we are acting swiftly now. I have already appointed a disciplinary commission, which has the full power to take all the decisions on behalf of the IOC.” The names or nationalities of those set to be implicated in the positive tests have not yet been revealed. The news follows on from 454 retrospective tests on samples from athletes that competed in Beijing in 2008, with 31 positive results revealed last week. A total of 14 of these new failures have been attributed to Russian athletes, with the threat that a number could have their medals stripped and given to other competitors.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'Ankara has demanded to have comedian Jan Boehmermann prosecuted for insulting a foreign head of state.\\xa0 Under a section of Germany\\'s criminal code, the government has to authorize prosecutors to pursue a case against the comedian. The code, known as Paragraph 103, concerns insults against organs or representatives of foreign states. However, it is so rarely used that many German politicians and lawyers were previously unaware of its existence. \"Turkey has demanded prosecution of Jan Boehmermann. [The] German government, in accordance with established practice, studied the note; this process involved the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Office of the Federal Chancellor. As a result, the federal government in regard to this incident, satisfies the request,\" Merkel told reporters\\xa0at the\\xa0Chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor went on to stress that it \"means\\xa0neither a prejudgment of the person affected nor a decision about the limits of freedom of art, the press and opinion.\" Merkel said that the government intends to repeal the law, effective in 2018.\\xa0 \"There were different opinions between the coalition partners - the conservatives and the SPD (Social Democrats),\" Merkel added. On Friday, German politicians from the “Green” party criticized Merkel\\'s decision to satisfy Ankara’s request, branding it a political mistake. “I believe Merkel’s decision is a political mistake. She has set up a trap for herself by politicizing the case, now she has to live with the accusation that the deal with Turkey [over the refugee crisis] became more important to her than freedom of speech,” Anton Hofreiter, head of the Green party, told TV channel N24. “Merkel should have made it clear from the start that we in Germany have a free press, while Erdogan should take better care of the press at home.” The head of the Social Democratic Party, Thomas Operman, also condemned Merkel’s move.\\xa0 “This decision is wrong. Prosecution of satire due to “lese-majeste” does not correspond with modern democracy,\" Operman wrote on Twitter. The German Union of Journalists (DJV) in their turn said such measures proposed by the chancellor do not correspond with German laws, adding that Merkel gave the “wrong signals” on the case to the Turkish government. “There was no need for the decision since the Turkish president has already filed a complaint to the Mainz Prosecutor.” On Monday, Erdogan filed a private lawsuit before sending a note to the German government demanding criminal prosecution of the presenter. Boehmermann read the\\xa0poem on Germany\\'s ZDF television two weeks ago. Although the\\xa0broadcaster withdrew the piece from its archives,\\xa0it said that no laws were broken. However, Boehmermann warned ahead of time that the reading would breach regulation on insulting foreign leaders.\\xa0 The Turkish government says the poem accused Erdogan of\\xa0“repressing minorities, kicking Kurds, and slapping Christians while watching child porn.” Turkey\\'s own press freedom has come under serious attack in recent months, including from Germany.\\xa0 In March, Ankara reportedly\\xa0pressured\\xa0Berlin into removing a satirical clip aired by public broadcaster NDR, which criticized the president for his crackdown on freedom of speech, as well as the alleged shuffling of electorate votes and cracking down on women. Earlier that month,\\xa0a correspondent for Germany\\'s Der Spiegel magazine was forced\\xa0to leave Turkey after his press credentials weren\\'t removed. The publication\\'s editor-in-chief accused Ankara of violating press freedom. Also last month, employees of Turkey\\'s Zaman newspaper said\\xa0they “feel like captives” following the government\\'s takeover of the daily. Since the paper\\'s seizure, it has has turned into a government mouthpiece, with the first edition under the new ownership immediately featuring a picture of Erdogan.\\xa0 Meanwhile, two journalists from Turkey\\'s Cumhuriyet newspaper are being charged with espionage after publishing a report in 2014 which purported to show Turkey\\'s state intelligence agency helping to transfer weapons into Syria by truck. The two spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the Constitutional Court ruled in February that their pre-trial detention was a violation of their rights. The journalists\\' detainment prompted criticism from international human rights groups, as well as from the EU and US Vice President Joe Biden, who said that Turkey was setting a poor example for the region by intimidating the media. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu previously stated that the two journalists should be released from prison ahead of the trial. ',\n",

              "  \"The vast majority of the country's citizens disagree with Merkel’s refugee policy, according to the\\xa0poll conducted last weekend. Asked whether “the federal government has the refugee situation under control,” 81 percent of Germans answered “No,” with just 18 percent saying “Yes.” Those answering “No” also included members of Merkel’s Christian Social Union, with a notable 67 percent of the party’s voters unhappy with the chancellor’s policies. Voter support for Merkel’s government dropped from 57 percent in July 2015 to 38 percent on February 2016 – “the worst estimate during the current government’s term,” the pollster said. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which advocates an anti-immigrant agenda became the third most influential party. It was projected to get 12 percent of the vote if the federal election were held this Sunday. Most Germans also think more restrictive measures towards refugees and asylum seekers must follow. A remarkable 88 percent believe the government should curb benefits for refugees who fail or are unwilling to integrate into German society, with 10 percent saying “No” – a measure previously announced by Germany’s Labor Minister Andrea Nahles. Introducing tougher border control on the EU’s external frontiers and a more detailed processing of asylum seeker applications, debated over the past months in Germany, was also widely supported. Some 63 percent said “Yes” to install the EU’s external border, while 33 percent were opposed. Consequently, 53 percent of Germans said border controls within EU countries – seen as threatening the Schengen border-free zone by many in Brussels – should be introduced as well. According to 77 percent of respondents Europe must also set up refugee centers at the EU’s external borders to process migrants’ applications and send back ineligible asylum seekers. The poll came alongside the so-called “Asylum package II” (Asylpaket II) – the newest set of measures by the German government designed to toughen refugee policies. The package includes putting limits on the number of asylum seekers admitted to Europe, and also an attempt to integrate those who have already reached Germany. Refugees will have to take integration courses, costing €10 a month. Germany accused of ‘paying’ African countries to take back ‘foreign’ asylum seekers https://t.co/TSsbzXu8rppic.twitter.com/auWTD38I0d Merkel’s government has come under fire for the chancellor’s “welcoming policy” towards refugees, who have recently arrived in Germany in overwhelming numbers. Although she says Germany can cope with the 1.1 million who have come in 2015 – and potentially more in 2016 – nearly 40 percent of Germans believe Merkel should step down over her refugee policy, according to January’s Insa\\xa0survey for Focus magazine. \",\n",

But hey – it\\'s not like the LHC was preparing to do anything important. It was merely getting ready to collect new data on the Higgs boson, a particle considered to be a cornerstone of the modern theory of particle physics. It\\'s not the first time that the LHC has suffered at the hands of animals. In 2009, a bird is believed to have dropped a baguette into the system’s machinery, causing an electrical short. When the LHC isn\\'t being shut down by mischievous critters, it focuses on solving the mystery of our universe, aiming to study a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang took place.

              "  \" The information about the S-300’s deployment was confirmed by ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. “Indeed, the Syrian Arab Republic received an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. This system is designed to ensure the safety of the naval base in [Syrian city of] Tartus and ships located in the coastal area [in Syria]…” he told the media. Konashenkov said it is unclear why the deployment of the missile system has created such a fuss\\xa0in the West. “The S-300 is a purely defensive system and poses no threat,” he said. He recalled that before the deployment of S-300, Russia had delivered Fort air defense missile systems to Syria. The statement comes after a report by Fox news that a Russian S-300 was deployed to Syria. The media cited three US officials who claimed that Moscow “continues to ramp up its military operations in Syria.” BREAKING: US suspends bilateral contact with Russia over Syria https://t.co/OpHCLJSMCEpic.twitter.com/7VNWOBdZXD In November 2015, Moscow deployed its newest S-400 air defense missile system to Khmeimim in Syria as part of a security boost following the downing of a Russian jet by Turkey near the border with that country. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the S-400 systems are not targeting Russia's partners, “with whom we fight terrorists in Syria together.” The S-400 is the most advanced anti-aircraft defense system in Russia. \",\n",

              "  'politics',\n",
              "  '“The idea of specialness, exceptionality and unique rights of the American state and American people has been used in US internal political rhetoric for quite a while, but in the recent years it is being actively and persistently offered in US foreign policy documents and public speeches on international politics delivered by US officials,” Judge Valery Zorkin said at the St Petersburg international legal forum on Thursday. READ MORE: ‘American exceptionalism’ hampers its war on terror – Lavrov “Any unbiased and educated person would see that this statement by Obama is an almost exact copy of leading politicians and propaganda specialists of the Third Reich, including Adolph Hitler… In essence, Obama is using the exact same thing that Nazi bosses said about the German exceptionalism when they started the world war,” he added. The judge also said that in his view the exceptionalism concept had direct influence on the modern US concepts of military planning and these concepts see the main objective of all activities as reaching such degree of military might that the United States remains out of reach of other nations, on land, sea, in air and in space. According to Zorkin, the same applies to the US doctrines on development of mass media and electronic communications – the US authorities see their goal as establishing absolute global domination of their country in the global information space. This idea also constantly appears in Obama’s public speeches. “Obama says that Americans and the USA are an exceptional people and an exceptional state and thus they can pretend for much more than any other people or state. In other words, he follows the plot of James Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ dystopia and, while formally not rejecting the principle of equality of sovereign states and peoples, fixed by the UN Charter, he still declares that Americans and America are ‘more equal’ than any other country and the rest of the planet’s population,” RIA Novosti quoted the judge as saying. Zorkin also told his colleague at the forum that he considered such approach to be a blatant violation of international legal norms. Russian politicians and officials have repeatedly addressed the topic of American exceptionalism when talking on bilateral relations with the US and of international politics in general. In particular, in mid-2015 President Vladimir Putin said in his speech before the UN General Assembly that attempts to influence internal politics of sovereign nations should not be tolerated regardless of where they are taking place and who are making such attempts. READ MORE: Violence instead of democracy: Putin slams ‘policies of exceptionalism and impunity’ in UN speech “It seems that some nations are not learning from others’ mistakes, but keep repeating them. The export of so-called ‘democratic’ revolutions continues.” Putin said. “I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, ‘Do you realize now what you have done?’” he said. “But I am afraid the question will hang in the air, because policies based on self-confidence and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.” ',\n",

              "  'After initially refusing to speak with reporters outside the luxurious, yet heavily-fortified Hotel Taschenbergpalais on Saturday, the PayPal co-founder finally took the bait and launched into a rant about libertarian ideology. Peter Thiel is a globalist Bilderberger. He didn\\'t go after Gawker because he believes in free speech or nationalism https://t.co/Oq7u4vaGXj While saying he feels “it’s always important to exchange views with people no matter what their perspectives are,” he added the caveat that they “need to be finding ways to talk to people where not everything is completely transparent.” While the official agenda for the three-day event has been released, those opposed to it have aired their unease at the way in which over 120 of the most powerful politicians, bankers, and industry leaders meet to discuss the “problems in our society,\" since it’s not clear what \"secret\" deals have been cut and later inflicted on people around the world who aren’t on the invite list. Bilderberg 2016: US election and refugees top of agenda at secret invite-only conference https://t.co/6fcRtaiuqxpic.twitter.com/Cfneh8A0yp “Libertarianism is not synonymous with radical transparency; that’s often an argument the Stasi would make in East Germany where everything had to be monitored by society,” Thiel said on Saturday. Wait doesn’t the NSA record everything? https://t.co/73zUAq5qMt Here\\'s a transcript of Peter Thiel\\'s response to @Lukewearechange re. #Bilderberg. Dense, problematic, fascinating.. pic.twitter.com/rcm7yqGNYk Peter Thiel says transparency is something the STASI would favor??! Favors secret meetings of Plutocrats? Just wow. https://t.co/q3Iq2qJcvK The irony of the statements weren\\'t missed by social media users, who were keen to note that Thiel sits on the board of directors at Facebook, a company renowned for its monitoring and monetization of its users’ data. Thiel defends secret Bilderberg talks, equating transparency and \"monitoring by society\" with communist oppression. https://t.co/na5dGSj62X The tech billionaire added: \"Often you have the best conversations in smaller groups where not everything is being monitored. That’s how you have very honest conversations and you can think better about the future.” This echoes similar comments from Thiel who, in 2009, wrote an essay entitled, \"The Education of a Libertarian” in which he admitted he “no longer believe[s] that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Thiel made headlines last month when he was outed as Hulk Hogan’s “secret” funding source for his lawsuit against Gawker, which caused the media organization to file for bankruptcy this week. READ MORE: Gawker files for bankruptcy after Hulk Hogan verdict, will be auctioned off His legal action was in response to a long-standing battle with the online publisher that started with their 2007 \"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\" Much like his views on “radical transparency,\" the lawsuit centered around privacy, free speech, and free press with Hogan ultimately winning $140 million in damages. Billionaire funding Hulk Hogan\\'s lawsuit against Gawker https://t.co/murR6wLyFJpic.twitter.com/EXhlMHugY8 You may hate Gawker, but if you cheer Thiel\\'s successful vendetta you also don\\'t care much for freedom of expression. A terrible precedent. You can bet he won\\'t be the last billionaire who will try to bleed a news org into bankruptcy https://t.co/Z8V8VEgG2h So many wealthy people must be looking at what Thiel did to Gawker & wondering how they can sue media companies they dislike into bankruptcy To ensure privacy at Bilderberg, organizers brought in Germany’s military and “corporate security from Airbus” to oversee event security, the Guardian\\xa0reported Army officers working alongside a private company got conspiracy theory websites all worked up, with one reporter from Infowars spotting what he believed to be “numerous vans, full of federal police covering their faces, carrying in bags full of weapons.” Thiel isn’t the only Silicon Valley investor at Bilderberg, but he is the only vocal supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump/Thiel 2016 If it’s okay for Peter Thiel to fund the demise of Gawker, it’s okay for Trump to fund the demise of a legit journalistic institution. The one Republican elected official at the conference, Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, previously suggested one of Bilderberg’s main talking points would be “how to beat Trump” and has issues with his party’s presumptive nominee.\\xa0 Ultra Rich in America starting to bug me: Elizabeth Holmes, Peter Thiel, Travis Kalanik, Trump -- y\\'all been pushing your luck lately.

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  \"Popular among fans, the 3-on-3 format for overtime periods was adopted by the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2015-2016 season, replacing the 4-on-4 format that the league had been using since the 1999-2000 season. Before that, overtime periods were played by the whole lines, with three forwards and two defensemen. The reduction of the number of skaters on the ice creates more open spaces, which allows players to get into the attacking zone easier and place more shots on the net, and significantly increases the chances to score. “The decision was unanimous,” said KHL President Dmitry Chernyshenko, TASS reported. “That format is used around the world, all around Europe. Hockey will become more entertaining.” The innovation will be also adopted by the Russian-based Junior Hockey League (MHL) and Women's Hockey League (WHL). The new format will, however, only be used in the regular season. “In the regular season overtimes will be played in the 3-on-3 format, in the playoffs in the 5-on-5 format,” the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's first vice-president, Roman Rotenberg, told TASS. \",\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"The ongoing large-scale Anakonda-16 NATO military maneuvers in Poland, simulating the repulsion of “Russian aggression” against the country, are counterproductive, Deutsche Welle cited German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper, in an interview to be published Sunday. “Whoever believes that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring security is mistaken,” Steinmeier said ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw beginning July 8. “We are well-advised to not create pretexts to renew an old confrontation,” he emphasized. 'Deadly irony: US calls Russia ‘aggressive’ as NATO creeps eastward' (Op-Edge by Robert Bridge) https://t.co/1k8aZ9k7uI Rather than inflaming the situation further “through saber-rattling and warmongering,” there ought to be more space for dialogue and cooperation with Moscow, Steinmeier said. It would be “fatal to now narrow the focus to the military, and seek a remedy solely through a policy of deterrence,” German FM said, calling to give way to diplomacy instead of military posturing. Calling for dialogue and a diplomatic approach, Steinmeier also mentioned the necessity of maintaining military preparedness of NATO. The alliance should also consider the possibility to “renew discussions about the benefits of disarmament and arms control for security in Europe,” he said. The Anaconda drills have become NATO’s largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War, bringing to Poland over 31,000 troops from 24 NATO member states and “partner nations,” including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and others. Moscow has once again pointed out that augmentation of NATO military presence in Eastern Europe and Baltics is unjustified, stressing that Russia has no plans whatsoever to interfere with any country in the region. “I am convinced that every serious and honest politician is well aware that Russia will never invade any NATO member. We have no such plans,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated. The NATO summit in Warsaw is set to put “Russian threat” issue high on the agenda, as the gathering will be making the final decision on stationing additional NATO troops in Eastern Europe. More NATO troops deployed to Poland will be sending “a clear signal that an attack on Poland will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance,” the bloc’s Secretary General told reporters following his meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June. The statements made by NATO leadership put Russian diplomats in a position where they have to deny the obvious. “During the NATO secretary general’s recent visit to Poland, officials in this country [Poland] made statements suggesting that from now on Russia would know that any attack on Poland would mean an attack on NATO as a whole. This is completely absurd because they are discussing a non-existent problem. There are no plans for any attacks on Poland,” Russian envoy to NATO Aleksandr Grushko said in an interview with TV channel Russia-24. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said that NATO has “an absolutely slapdash attitude to our position on anything,” adding that it was the US that had unilaterally quit the missile defense treaty, which was initially signed to “provide strategic balance in the world.” NATO “needs a foreign enemy, otherwise what would be the reason for the existence of such an organization,” said the Russian leader. The conflict in Ukraine, caused by a bloody coup supported by the US and its European NATO allies, was forced on that country “to substantiate the very existence of the North Atlantic alliance,” the Russian president concluded. Putin assured his audience that he does not want to proceed to a new Cold War, as “no one wants it.”“However dramatic the logic of the development of international relations might seem on the outside, it’s not the logic of global confrontation,” he explained. \",\n",

However, I’ve no doubt the NHS will pull out all the stops as it has done in the other two strikes, to minimize the disruption. “We are expecting around 5,000 procedures to be affected and need to be rescheduled as a result of the action over the next couple of days,” she added. An Ipsos Mori poll showed that 65 percent of the public support the strikes.

Got to love Dennis Skinner for his commitment pic.twitter.com/ucX7VellIX “As the government forces us into another round of industrial action, it seriously needs to think whether the pride that has got themselves into this appalling mess is really the legacy they want to leave, or whether trying to find a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of the government, the NHS, patients and all the people of this country,” he wrote. The two-day strike is the third since the New Year and was organized after talks between the government and junior doctors broke down, with Hunt deciding to impose the new contract without agreement. Previous strikes have focused on adjustments to pay and overtime working hours, which junior doctors said would leave them working longer hours for less pay, despite the government insisting that the new contract would result in a net pay rise of 13.5 percent. Visited the #juniordoctors on picket line this morning outside Hillingdon Hospital to show 100% support from me pic.twitter.com/GbxSbDWKtd A deal was almost reached during last-minute talks, but eventually they collapsed after both parties refused to compromise on Saturday pay. Currently junior doctors net a premium rate for working on a Saturday, but new government plans would see Saturday treated as a regular working day, meaning doctors could lose out. Many Labour MPs joined picket lines on Wednesday morning, including Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and veteran MP Dennis Skinner. The Green Party has openly backed the strike, and its health spokesperson Larry Sanders called Hunt a “hypocrite.” “The hypocrisy of Jeremy Hunt announcing that he was imposing a contract on junior doctors exactly one year after he ‘called time on NHS bullying’ is astounding. Those junior doctors are essential to a functioning NHS and they will go on to become leaders of the service. They need to be treated with the respect that they deserve.” \",\n",

However, by highlighting the sexual orientation of the Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, the newspaper found itself in hot water, with many accusing it of “outright homophobia.” If the worst they can say about you is you're an OPENLY GAY EX-OLYMPIC FENCER TOP JUDGE, you've basically won life. pic.twitter.com/j8tUTjODuP Guardian Columnist Owen Jones, who has often spoken about the prejudice he has been subjected to as a gay man, took to Twitter saying: “I’d like to take back control from this bigoted crap.” Another user, whose Twitter name is Neil Marshall, said: “High Court announcement has revealed a new homophobic and racist low from today’s Daily Mail.

Dervish was the first of 78 convoys that delivered 4 million tons of supplies, including 7,000 aircraft and 5,000 tanks, to the USSR between August 1941 and May 1945. Thousands of sailors braved freezing temperatures and the constant threat of attacks to deliver provisions, ammunition and fighter planes. Three thousand sailors were lost in the operations. More than 3000 British troops and their comrades perished during #ArcticConvoys. We honour them all #Dervish75pic.twitter.com/ZDDq5nTiwl The events in Arkhangelsk were also attended by more than 40 Allied World War Two veterans, many of whom maintain friendly relations with the former Soviet Army veterans living in Russia. Some of them also told RT they do not share the anti-Russian sentiments expressed by some Western elites. “If we keep friendship at this level… then hopefully we can influence the politicians,” one of the veterans told RT.

The Arctic convoys provided 23 percent of lend-lease supplies to the Soviet Union during World War Two, worth $13.5 billion. ',\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The American people, and the world, are currently being treated to an annual parade of charisma-challenged, very rich and predominately white mummies, appearing on vast stages bedecked in Stars & Stripes and other symbols of US exceptionalism, reading prepared speeches from an autocue in front of audiences of placard-waving, holler-whooping people bused in from every town in the country. Meanwhile, outside the auditoria where these circuses are being held, the people from downtown are protesting, doing their best to avoid getting their skulls cracked by police batons in the process. Is there anybody anywhere who still believes that democracy and America are words that belong together in the same sentence? Rather than a government of the people, by the people, for the people, the truth of American democracy is, in the words of US economist Joseph Stiglitz, a government of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. Both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rather than glowing examples of democracy in action, instead afford the 99 percent a ringside seat at the struggle between rival political representatives of the super rich for the privilege of being the one who will screw them over for the next four years. It is a contest to see which group of rich patrons, campaign donors, and corporate sponsors will gain most from whoever is in the White House next. A US presidential election is less about governing the country and more about dividing up the succulent, juicy pie of corporate welfare between those who already have too much yet still want more. For it is greed not democracy that drives politics in the land of the free, greed for money, power, prestige, status and fame. This particular election year comes at a point where it is no longer possible to continue the pretense that America is the greatest country on earth, that shining city on the hill of which every dewy-eyed patriot boasts. In truth it is a country, political system and society in crisis, wherein a war of all against all is raging in its towns and cities, pitting police departments kitted out with more weaponry than your average army against low income and minority communities, inhabited by people who have seen their lives decimated under both Democrat and Republican administrations over the years, administrations in thrall to the rich and corporate America, whose theft and larceny would make Al Capone blush it is so outrageous. In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are squaring off for what is already one of the most vicious and acrimonious campaigns for the White House ever fought. At the Republican Convention the mantra in the audience was “Lock her up! Lock her up!” with all it needed was someone to start waving a hangman’s noose for the posse to be on its way to her house. Trump promises to “Make America Great Again,” a sufficiently open-ended slogan to mean anything his supporters want it to mean. Given the billionaire’s polarizing message on immigrants and Muslims, the way he has made white supremacy cool again, it is no surprise that many in America are dreading the prospect of him becoming president. But, yet, when it comes to foreign policy, at least Trump is not promising to wage war without end on the world and is less than enthusiastic about NATO. This alone marks him out as a refreshing departure from the norm. Clinton, meanwhile, is a woman for whom foreign policy and cruise missiles are two sides of the same coin. She comes to the race as the progressive candidate, though only by dint of a grotesque mangling of the English language could the destruction of entire countries, the gloating over the murder of an African leader, and threatening to unleash war on anyone that dares stand in America’s way be described as progressive. Moreover, for someone presented to the American people as a champion of the poor, working people, and those struggling to make ends meet, she and her husband have some\\xa0interesting friends and supporters - Wall Street and George Soros prime among them – who aren’t exactly struggling to get by. Then, too, the sympathy she’s expressed for the increasing number of black victims of police brutality and shootings is belied by her vociferous support for her husband Bill’s notorious crime bill, which his administration drafted in the early nineties and which ushered in the mass incarceration of black people and other minorities. This democratic circus of the RNC and DNC takes place as the presidency of Barack Obama winds down to its ignominious end. It is a two-term presidency that can he measured by the answer to one simple question. How many mothers are childless and children orphans as a result of the decisions his administration made over the last nine years? LIVE on #Periscope: Watch Donald Trump speak at #RNCinCLEhttps://t.co/4u91jEcVo7 The question answers itself, as it does when applied to every US president and administration since the end of the Second World War, condemning each and every one with crimes against humanity committed on a mammoth scale. It is why the gulf between the Hollywood circus that is the Republican and Democrat National Conventions – with their nauseating celebration of US exceptionalism – and the reality for the millions who have suffered and will continue to suffer regardless of who enters the White House this year exposes US democracy as a sham. It is the best democracy that money can buy. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"Speaking during an exclusive interview with the Times of Israel, SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum accused Netanyahu of being personally involved in a bureaucratic process which forced the company to fire its Palestinian employees. According to Birnbaum, it all began when SodaStream decided it needed more space, and opted to close its West Bank factory. The move did, however, follow a boycott campaign\\xa0against the company, in which critics accused it of making money on land “stolen” by Israel.  Though Birnbaum insists the move was made voluntarily, he says the Israeli government is arguing that SodaStream was forced to move due to the pressure from the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as fire the 500 Palestinians working there. But the company insists that despite claims from the Netanyahu government, it wanted to retain 350 of its 500 Palestinian employees to work at its new plant in the Negev. However, according to Birnbaum keeping such a high number of employees was impossible because the company was initially only granted permits for 120 of the Palestinian workers – a number which new conditions later reduced to 74. Since February, those remaining 74 employees have been barred from Israel, their permits retroactively canceled. “Apparently our 74 Palestinians represent a threat to [Netanyahu's] agenda,” Birnbaum said. The CEO says Netanyahu – who he refers to as the “prime minister of conflict” – is responsible for the outcome, adding that his office “intervened to stop the employment of our Palestinians so that Bibi [Netanyahu] can then point a finger at the BDS.” Birnbaum did not mince his words when speaking about the prime minister, accusing him of “systematically spreading hate within Israel between Jews and Arabs and between Orthodox and secular...” “It pains me to say that I believe this administration is nurturing the conflict in all its evil manifestations. They nurture the hate and the boycott and they nurture separatism,” he said. Unsurprisingly, the story coming from Netanyahu's office is starkly different. An official who asked to remain anonymous told the Times of Israel that Birnbaum had relocated his factory because of pressure from the BDS movement. He then noted that once SodaStream was out of the West Bank and inside Israel, it was required to comply with Israeli labor laws – meaning priority had to be given to Israeli workers. “SodaStream went from no quotas at Mishor Adumim, moved inside the Green Line, and was required to follow Israeli labor laws,” the official said. “So it had to lose its Palestinian workers.” The official went on to accuse Birnbaum of being ungrateful towards Netanyahu, as the PM had assisted Birnbaum with a grace period during the transition, arranging for two extensions for Palestinian workers. “The prime minister wanted to help make the transition more smooth. The lack of gratitude is appalling,” the official said. “The PM could have said, ‘We’re not helping him at all.’ Maybe we shouldn’t have helped him. To say it’s personal animus is despicable.” Meanwhile, Birnbaum says that Netanyahu would benefit from taking a leaf out of SodaStream's book, choosing to boost the number of Palestinians working in Israel rather than depriving them of opportunities. He stated that the biggest terrorist threat from Palestinians stems from those working in Israel without permission, stressing that such permits could “buy security.” \",\n",

              "  'uk',\n",
              "  ' Current EU rules allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block content for three reasons: to comply with a member state’s laws, to manage levels of traffic across a network, or for security. The net neutrality rules are intended to prevent broadband operators from favoring specific sources of content such as commercial partners. Blocking porn falls into a gray area, as there is no clear legal framework in UK legislation. However, a revision to the guidelines issued by EU body Berec says blocked content, whether it is porn or ads, should be implemented by a customer on their device, rather than by the network. Frode Sorensen, co-chair of the Berec working group on net neutrality, refused to comment to the Guardian on specific cases or countries, but said the updated guidance made it clear there was no legal basis for using customer choice to justify blocking any content. ISPs Sky, BT and TalkTalk, and mobile operator O2 block access to adult sites following pressure from the government. Mobile operator Three recently ran an ad-blocking trial that required users to opt in. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson told the newspaper the rules still allowed for internet filters. “Family-friendly filters are permitted under the EU net neutrality regulation. The regulations give end-users the right to access information and content of their choice, and enabling/disabling filters exercises this choice.” A spokesperson for BT told the newspaper: “BT offers filtering at both network and device level dependent on the customer’s preferences. “The Berec guidelines are not binding and it’s for Ofcom to consider in its application and enforcement of EU regulations.” It a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom will monitor compliance with the new rules, and look into any complaints received. We will consider any potential breaches as they arise in accordance with our interpretation of the regulation, and drawing upon the Berec guidelines to inform our approach.” ',\n",

              "  'Belgian investigators revealed at least five of the suspects behind the terror attacks on Paris and Brussels were receiving welfare benefits prior to the atrocities. The Wall Street Journal was one of the first media outlets that reported\\xa0on the story.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were receiving welfare benefits?\\xa0 Gerolf Annemans: People must know that Belgium is one of the most Islamised countries of Western Europe. My party especially concentrates on Jihadi fighters coming back from Syria and what they are still receiving after they’ve gone to Syria. Some of them received health care; we repaired their legs, etc. We discovered also that most of these Syrian fighters get allowances after proving that they are not able to get work. So this is a general phenomenon. Now we are very glad, because the Belgium press put this aside, never focused on it and never mentioned it. And we are very glad that The Wall Street Journal does this now and that we are joined now by the international press, because in Belgium the battle is very severe. The media and the regime are doing this because of what we call the Islamosocialism. All governments in Belgium are either left-wing or central-left wing, or at least are doing what they are doing now and what has been discovered now.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system. What should be done to prevent them from receiving welfare payments?\\xa0 GA: First of all, we have to choose other leaders, elect other leaders; leaders that have steel teeth, and can bite and can fight against Islamization of our society, and for instance blocking the social security. It is an enormous tragedy that we are in this paradox that the Belgium taxpayers paid for this Islamic attacks. We need other leaders, we need other leadership, we need to rethink our western democracies.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Do you think there could be more incidents like this?\\xa0 GA: Well, we have the tragedy of the asylum seekers, the millions that come now and that are all on our social security, because only a tiny minority gets work and helps our economy, or deals with our economy. So most of them end up in our social security system, which is, by the way, the reason why they come to Europe. They don’t stop where it is safe, or where there are no bullets shot anymore. They stop where there is social security. That is why they come to Germany, to Belgium, to Holland, and not to the other countries that they travel leaving Syria. This is a serious mistake to think that we have to change the people of Europe, that we have to exchange them with a new Islamic and mostly Muslim people. This is a failure, a mistake, politically, culturally, in every sense of the word.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Many of the attacks were carried out not by refugees, but by the people who were born or raised in the EU. How do you propose to deal with those kind of people?\\xa0 GA: These people, the people that are here, and are peaceful, and are not radicalizing, or are not promoting Muslim society on Western Europe soil, these people should get the message from our politicians, from our political regimes that they should adapt to our culture of our society. And for the rest we should close the borders that the EU opened widely. We must not let [Angela] Merkel decide our future. People and countries like ours should decide upon that themselves. The Merkel, the [Jean-Claude] Juncker, and the EU way of dealing with these problems is not the way we want it. The people should stand up and vote for leaders in their countries that promise to stop all these.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0How is it possible that people, who later turned out to be terrorists, were getting welfare benefits?\\xa0 Jean Bricmont: I think that is a very bad argument. Of course, if the people knew that they were plotting terrorist attack then it was not a matter of cutting welfare, but putting them away in jail, or under surveillance, or something. The argument against welfare, which is used here, is very bad. It suggests that we should cut welfare, but to whom? To all the Muslim, to all the suspects, to everybody? The present government is already cutting welfare, and welfare has been cut and cut over the years. I think if anything it will probably increase the danger, because it would put more people in a precarious situation, which may lead them to violent action. I don’t think welfare is the problem at all. In fact fiscal fraud is much, much bigger than the welfare spending. So if welfare could prevent the terrorist attack it would be a very small amount of money. You might find it shocking that people on welfare kill other people, but what is shocking is not that they get welfare, but that they kill other people. If they had a job and were not receiving welfare, I would find it just as terrible and shocking.\\xa0\\xa0 It seems to me that The Wall Street Journal, in line with its neoliberal agenda, is trying to use this argument against welfare, which I think is a very bad argument. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is psychologically shocking, but stop and think about it. Stop welfare to whom?\\xa0 If we know that they are terrorists than it is not a matter of welfare, it is a matter of putting them under police control – so a very different business.\\xa0 RT:\\xa0Islamic State has previously encouraged its followers to tap into the European benefits system.\\xa0 You would prefer then to ignore that fact, wouldn’t you?\\xa0 JB: Well, the question is: what did the police know? Obviously we should fight the Islamic State. I myself would be in favor of joining Russia in Syria and fighting them, other than doing what\\xa0 we do, which is inefficient bombing. That is a problem on the ground, it is not a problem of Belgian citizens, or even migrants in European countries…\\xa0 RT: How do you assess the level of security in the EU right now in the wake of a spate of horrific attacks, many of which were carried out by refugees?\\xa0 JB: It is pretty bad, but the point is that they are not refugees. Many of these people were citizens of the European countries. They grew up here. I don’t know every individual case, but many of the terrorists grew up here. They got very upset with… the trouble we created in the Middle East and the instability we created there.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  'Although the votes are still being counted in some states, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote with nearly 59.8 million votes, compared to Trump’s almost 59.6 million votes \\xa0– a lead of about 0.2 percentage points or more than 200,000 votes. Winning the popular vote is a bitter consolation prize for Clinton, as overall victory is based on the 538 members of the Electoral College, each of whom represent a state or the District of Columbia based on population. The number of electoral voters a state gets is equal to its representation in Congress, with a minimum of three (Delaware, DC, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) and a maximum of 55 (California). The winning candidate must receive at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. With Michigan (16) and New Hampshire (4) still outstanding, Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton only 218. Trump is set to become the second president in 16 years to win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote; George W. Bush was the first in the controversial 2000 election. However, it happened twice in 12 years in the 1800s: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Hayes suffered the biggest loss in the popular vote, losing by 3 percentage points to Southern Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Trump comes in second at 1.2 points. Both Bush and Harrison lost by less than a point to Vice President Al Gore and incumbent President Grover Cleveland respectively, according to Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidents. There is one other time that a president entered the White House without winning the popular vote, but that was in 1824, due to a four-way race that did not produce a winner in the Electoral College, forcing the House of Representatives to decide, in accordance with the 12th Amendment. The House elected John Quincy Adams as president. At that point in time, candidates did not run as a combined presidential and vice presidential ticket, and John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency outright. The situation that Trump finds himself in is thus relatively rare, but shifting demographics in the country mean that it could happen more often in the future, according to Vox. The US is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2055, there will not be a single racial or ethnic majority, the Pew Research Center found ahead of the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meeting. Most of those population gains by minorities are occurring in solidly Democratic and solidly Republican states, which means that they did nothing to shift the electoral map. While Trump made headway into all racial and ethnic groups compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, it was still whites who handed him his victory, with 58 percent voting for him, compared to 37 percent for Clinton. Whites made up 70 percent of voters on Tuesday. Trump gained 7 percentage points among black voters, 8 points among Hispanic and Latinos, 11 percent among Asians and 1 percent among other ethnic groups, according to a New York Times analysis of exit polling. However, that doesn’t mean he did well among those groups. The vast majority of black voters (88 percent) chose Clinton, as did 65 percent each of Hispanic/Latino and Asian voters, while 56 percent of people belonging to other ethnic groups voted for Clinton. Millennials ‒ in this case defined as those born after 1980 ‒ have likely replaced the baby boomers as the largest generation. Trump again made headway with this group, gaining 5 points over Romney, but lost the group overall. More than half (55 percent) voted for Clinton, while only 37 percent opted for Trump. It was voters age 45 and older ‒ the baby boomers and Generation X ‒ who gave him the victory, with 53 percent voting for Trump. So basically, Trump won because of older white people, according to @nytimes & @cnn analyses of exit polling pic.twitter.com/rkfXLWixau If millennials had been the only voters, it would have been a landslide victory for Clinton in the Electoral College. Instead, however, they were in the minority, making up only 44 percent of voters on Tuesday. This is how the future voted. This is what people 18-25 said in casting their votes. We must keep this flame alight and nurture this vision. pic.twitter.com/ivuXrar869 There is one place that the popular vote does matter, however: third parties. If a third-party candidate receives 5 percent of the vote, then their party is eligible to receive federal grants from the Federal Election Commission in the 2020 general election. Unfortunately for Libertarian Gary Johnson (less than 4.1 million), Green Jill Stein (just over 1.2 million) and independent Evan McMullin (about 423,000), none of them reached the necessary milestone. If all their votes were to be combined, they would come to just under 5.7 million, or about half a million votes short. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"The yearly manned space flights, part of Russia’s moon exploration program, will include flyovers and landings on the lunar surface. In order to achieve these goals, Russia plans to use a new type of a manned spacecraft called the Federatsiya (Federation). Russian space rocket corporation Energia will start construction of the spacecraft and software development this summer, the company’s chief designer told journalists. The Federatsiya will be a new generation vessel to replace the currently used Soyuz spaceships. It is designed for transferring people and delivering cargo to the moon and the International Space Station (ISS). Its crew will be four to six cosmonauts. The spaceship is expected to be able to operate autonomously for up to 30 days. It can be deployed to the ISS for up to one year. The testing of the spacecraft is expected to start in 2021, with an unmanned flight launched from Russia’s new Vostochny spaceport in the Far Eastern Amur region. The first test will be followed by two more launches in 2023, including one manned flight. The Angara A5B heavy carrier rocket will be used for the launches, TASS reports. Earlier, it was reported that Federatsiya test flights will include four launches, two of which will be manned and one will involve a flyover of the moon. Energia Corporation has already unveiled another project designed for a potential lunar trip. The company presented draft plans for a new reusable space vehicle to shuttle cargo and crews between the ISS and the moon called the Ryvok (Charge of Breakthrough) at the Human Space Exploration international conference in Korolev, near Moscow, on May 26. The Ryvok spacecraft will be permanently based on the ISS – or its descendant – and will serve as the mid-way shuttle for delivering cargo and crews to the moon, the representatives of the company said at the conference, adding that Ryvok will be much more cost efficient compared to the Federatsiya spacecraft. The Energia Corporation and NASA are also discussing a project to create a joint space station orbiting the moon, which could be put into operation by the end of the next decade, Energia's representative Yuri Makushenko told journalists at the conference. The new space station will have accommodation and energy modules as well as nodes and spaceships, he added. The new station is expected to become a transport hub for maintenance, communications and navigation of the lunar missions and for un-manned missions to Mars and the asteroid belt between the Red Planet and Jupiter. \",\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  \"Sunday’s general election Russia saw people vote for members of the lower house, the State Duma and several regional heads. With almost all the votes counted, the ruling United Russia party is likely to secure the majority of seats in the Duma. It's followed by the Russian Communist party (KPRF) and the Liberal Democrats (LDPR), who are neck and neck. Fair Russia has also made it to the lower house with about 6 percent of the votes. The result of the vote didn’t come as any surprise. Various polls and analysts predicted United Russia was going to remain the majority party. However, Western media criticized the election dubbing it “a show” and “a farce” even before it started. Yvan Blot, former member of the French and European Parliaments, says this election result reminded him of the French presidential elections when Charles de Gaulle “had 50 percent of the votes.” “It is the same now in Russia with United Russia, Putin’s party. What strikes me is that all political parties in the majority and in the opposition are patriotic. It is not the case in France, I must admit,” he told RT. Former French MP Blot, commenting on the matter said Western countries should mind their own election process. State Duma elections start in Russia https://t.co/bQvOEODkBO For instance, in France, the system “is less democratic than the Russian one,” he said. He referred to the way Russian lawmakers are elected to the Duma: half of the MPs are elected from single-mandate districts (one candidate per district), the other half - from party candidate lists on a proportional basis. “In France we have a more simple system: every candidate comes from a constituency. But constituencies were designed by the most powerful party some years ago. With the result of 1/3 of the votes the National Front has only two members of Parliament. Is that democratic? It is not democratic at all. It is the same for the extreme left. [It] has very few members of Parliament, but they have voices,” he said. “Besides, candidates in France are selected in general by little committees of oligarchs within political parties. We have no primaries, except now in the Republican Party Presidential election. But in general it is not a tradition to have primaries,” Blot said. Primaries had not been a common thing for Russia either until this year, when ahead of the September 18 parliamentary vote, United Russia held nationwide primaries. The third “big problem” in France, according to Blot, is that opinions of political leaders differ from those of voters. “For that reason people are very deceived by all political parties. In France the rate of trust for a political party is only 18 per cent of the people. I think we have no lesson to give to Russia about democracy. Russia is not perfect – perfection doesn’t exist in the world. But I think the system has much improved since some years and now it is more democratic than in France,” the former MP said. Adam Garrie, author at The Duran says the Western media painted the Russian vote “as a show” because they “don’t want to admit that the democracy in Russia is indeed one of the most vibrant and, more importantly, diverse in the free world”. “When you just listen to some of the many debates in the Duma, you’ve got a broader range of opinions than you’ve got in the British Parliament, in the US Congress, or most places in Europe,” he told RT. In recent years, the Russian government has introduced a number of changes to make elections more representative. For instance, the threshold for parties to get into parliament was lowered to 5 percent and a prominent human rights activist, Ella Pamfilova was appointed to head the Central Election Commission. Garrie explains Western media have an agenda, “and the agenda doesn’t rely on the facts”. “The fact of the matter is that the Russian government has gone out of its way to make this one of the most widespread free and fair elections possible from opening polling stations in some of the most remotest parts of the world – to videotaping all the polling stations to catch any possible irregularities when and as they happen. This factual truth isn’t something that seems to match the Western narrative – that says the Russian electoral system is somehow backwards or undemocratic. Perhaps they are ashamed that the Russian system is slightly more democratic and certainly more ideologically and personally diverse than a lot of place in the so-called West,” he said.\\xa0 The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT. \",\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'According to an official notification from the national RTA SE media body, the suspension will come into force in 60 days. The channel will be excluded from free transmission, but will still remain in paid TV packages. The media governing body expressed its “gratitude” for a fruitful cooperation and the contribution of RT Spanish to the national satellite and digital broadcasts in a letter signed by RTA’s Maria Eugenia Martinez, who emphasized that current notification of suspension “does not prevent the conclusion of other future partnerships.” On June 7, a similar letter was sent to the pan-Latin American terrestrial and satellite television network TeleSUR TV, notifying that its broadcasting in Argentina would be suspended within 15 days. TeleSUR President Patricia Villegas denounced the move as “censorship” on the part of the right-wing Argentine president Mauricio Macri and his government. Both letters cited the “need to renew the program listings” of Argentina’s Experimental System of Digital Terrestrial Television and Satellite Television Systems as the reason for suspensions. Censura @mauriciomacri a @teleSURtv#NoNosCallarán#TeleSURConArgentinapic.twitter.com/Mxb3l9UfE9 “The official explanation has been that they need those channels presently occupied by the RT Spanish signal, and also the TeleSur Venezuela signal. The government is saying, officially, that they need those two frequency slots to transmit provincial channels, channels from Argentinian provinces, for example Tierra del Fuego which is way down in the South,” said international political analyst and RT contributor Adrian Salbuchi. “But that is hardly a credible explanation of any sort whatsoever.” READ MORE: RT and Venezuela TeleSUR journalists unite to provide fresh perspective on news “RT and also TeleSUR… definitely [have] a very alternative view on international politics, finance, economic treaties, for example like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so forth… regrettably, what we are seeing at least in Argentina is a case of censorship where the government does not want alternative viewpoint… to be heard by the Argentinian population,” Salbuchi added. OP-EGDE: ‘RT broadcast halt in Argentina is all-out psychological onslaught on Latin America’ “I think that part of this is an effort to deny the citizens of Argentina the opportunity to hear a plurality of voices about what is taking place in other countries in the region,” believes RT Spanish “Behind the News” host and attorney Eva Golinger. “This is a government that has just completed six months in office. It’s a really narrow timeframe, and yet they’ve already taken harsh measures… TeleSUR may have had a more critical voice towards the government, but this is a government that ran on a platform saying they were promoting wider democracy and more freedoms in Argentina. And now we are seeing that what they are actually doing is the opposite.” Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Upper House committee for foreign affairs, said that the main reason for RT’s suspension “is the shift in the power in Argentina” after pro-American Mauricio Macri became president in late 2015. According to the official, the move is one of the first signs of Argentina’s rapprochement with the US. “The US always and everywhere are trying to consistently monopolize the information realm and remove all other alternative sources of information. We know how concerned the US authorities are by the popularity of RT,” Kosachev stressed. The decision to launch RT’s Spanish-language channel as part of the Latin American country’s national television broadcast in 2014 was applauded by the presidents of Russia and Argentina. “Harsh information wars and the attempts of some countries to monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests have become a sign of modern times,”\\xa0President Vladimir Putin said at the time, stressing that “in these circumstances alternative sources of information are particularly in demand. RT is definitely one of them.” Former Argentinian leader\\xa0Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\\xa0also praised the initiative back in 2014 saying, “we are really glad to welcome RT Spanish in Television Digital Terrestre (TDA), which is available all over the country.”  ',\n",

              "  'The 30-year-old powered her way into the decider with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Switzerland\\'s Timea Bacsinszky in sweltering conditions. Kuznetsova’s never-say-die spirit was again on show as almost two hours of scintillating action came to a conclusion with a winning backhand from the Russian. Our first #MiamiOpen singles finalist has been decided! We\\'ll see you on Saturday, Svetlana Kuznetsova. pic.twitter.com/2oK0NXjiHk The veteran shocked the tennis community by beating world number one and hot favorite Serena Williams in the fourth round and will now look to claim glory in a tournament she last won in 2006. READ MORE:\\xa0Russia\\'s Svetlana Kuznetsova knocks Serena Williams out of Miami Open Kuznetsova said finishing Bacsinszky in two sets could well be decisive come this weekend’s clash. \"I am happy that I could hang in there and never let my hands down,” she said. \"I have not been feeling my best but I have been fighting every ball and just trying to run as much as I could. \"I was praying to finish it in two sets so I can have a little bit of time to rest.” Should Kuznetsova claim glory on Saturday it would be a welcome piece of news for Russian tennis following Maria Sharapova’s suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium. Azarenka represents a tough opponent, however, with the Belarusian making light work of second seed Angelique Kerber to make the final. The 13th seed lost to Kerber in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January, but claimed an impressive 6-2 7-5 victory on Thursday. Sweet, sweet Vik-tory.Victoria Azarenka is headed back to the #MiamiOpen finals. pic.twitter.com/A72J1gtPIG The match took 94 minutes but Azarenka always looked in the ascendancy and will hope to claim glory after winning the Miami Open back in 2011. \"I am very happy I stayed really strong in the end and actually started really well,” she said. \"I started to dictate (early) and I think the beginning was really important. She\\'s such a fighter and an amazing player. I\\'m glad I kept pushing and kept trying to break her rhythm.” 2006 #TBT-Song: Daniel Powter\\'s \"Bad Day\"-Movie: Pirates of the Caribbean 2-Miami Open Champ: Svetlana Kuznetsova pic.twitter.com/s7colWpMwe Williams dominated tennis in 2015, winning three of the four majors, but has not been at her awe-inspiring best so far this year. This has handed others a chance to claim glory, and Kuznetsova will know that she has all the weaponry to confirm tournament victory after beating the American impressively earlier in the competition.

One fan says: \"Flight\\'s cancelled - they\\'ve rebooked us on Lufthansa.\" The other replies: \"Lufthansa? We\\'re flying with the Germans?!\" The scene switches to the plane, where the younger fan is sitting in front of a traditional Bavarian \\'oompah band\\'. A young fan in a Germany shirt brandishes four fingers towards the Englishman - in reference to the Germans’ four World Cup wins. But it all turns to be just a bad dream for the England fan, as he is later served a cold beer – although the young German fan continues to taunt him from the seat behind. England fans have generally enjoyed their journeys to Germany in recent years, having not lost there since 1987. Whether Lufthansa\\'s efforts reach the dizzy heights of other aviation/football-themed videos is open to debate, with Turkish Airlines\\' 2011 Manchester United commercial one of the best from the past few years. While Wayne Rooney thundering a volley on a plane at Bobby Charlton\\'s head is a thing of genius, undoubtedly the finest ever football commercial has to be Nike\\'s airport-based 1998 offering featuring one of the most talented Brazilian teams in history. Maybe British Airways can use some of these as inspiration for a retaliatory video towards Lufthansa? ',\n",

After the hearing the committee took a recess before delivering its verdict. CSKA Moscow and Finland midfielder Roman Eremenko gets two-year ban from UEFA after testing positive for cocaine. “The Finnish player has been suspended for two years from all competitions, following the positive result of a doping control test in competition undergone by the player after the UEFA Champions League group stage match between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and PFC CSKA Moskva played on 14 September 2016 in Germany,” the press release reads. After giving a positive sample for cocaine, but before being suspended, Eremenko played against Spurs in CL and in 3 Russian league games. “The analysis of the A sample revealed the presence of cocaine and its metabolites - a stimulant that is classified under the category of prohibited substances in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 2016 Prohibited List under class S6 - being prohibited in-competition. “The player was found guilty of being in breach of the UEFA Anti-Doping Regulations, Edition 2016. As a result, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body decided to impose a two-year ban on Roman Eremenko, starting from 6 October 2016 date of the provisional suspension.

The following morning, the information was confirmed by CSKA and then FIFA announced the player would be banned from all competitions for that time. It then extended the ban based on the UEFA verdict. Eremenko, who has won 73 caps for his national side, has the right to appeal the ruling. Earlier this month, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) gave Algerian forward Youcef Belaili a two-year ban on appeal for cocaine after throwing out a previous four-year sanction on procedural grounds.

              "  'GCHQ has recruited several thousand more people as the “task of tackling complex threats becomes more difficult and labor intensive,” the Times\\xa0reported. The majority of the thousands of extra staff hired as contractors are thought to come from the private sector, according to the newspaper. “They are all security-vetted and sworn to secrecy.” David Davis, a Conservative Party MP, told the Times that secrecy surrounding GCHQ’s numerical strength was “a bad opening chapter to this new era of transparency.” A spokesperson for GCHQ declined to give exact numbers of those employed in the agency and its partners. \"The total number of people working for or with GCHQ constantly fluctuates due to the complex challenges we face and the threats we aim to counter,\" the spokesperson told IBTimes UK, adding: \"In a complex organization like GCHQ, as you would expect, our core mission is supported by a range of partners including industry and the military.” GCHQ employed 5,683 full-time staff in August 2014, according\\xa0to official figures from the UK parliament\\'s Intelligence and Security Committee. MI5 had 3,926 and MI6 2,430 employees.\\xa0 “We should be asking why are these numbers so secret? And who is paying for all these people? Is Britain paying or is GCHQ doing things for other people who are paying?” Mr Davis told the Times. In November, UK Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hire over 1,900 new spies, citing growing security concerns. \"We need to do more to ensure our agencies have the resources and the information they need to prevent and disrupt plots against this country at every stage. So in next week\\'s strategic defense and security review, we will make a major additional investment in our world class intelligence agencies. This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counter-terrorism experts in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,\" Cameron said. \"We will also more than double our spending on aviation security around the world with more experts overseas working side by side with host nations in the most vulnerable locations. We also need to do more to make sure the powers we give our security services keep pace with changes in technology,\" he added. Last month, the UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (a judicial body independent of the British government, which hears complaints about surveillance by public bodies) was told that GCHQ is “persistent” in its hacking of phones and computers across the globe. GCHQ activities include using the microphones and cameras built into devices to spy on people, locate their position and access documents and pictures, lawyers representing civil liberties group Privacy International told the tribunal. The intelligence agency cited the heightened threat of terrorism to justify its actions, saying: “Over the last year the threat to the UK from international terrorism has continued to increase,” James Eadie, representing GCHQ, said in his written arguments to the tribunal. The case was brought in light of revelations by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who exposed the extent of GCHQ surveillance.  ',\n",

              "  'op-edge',\n",
              "  'The UN special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said he is “shocked and appalled by the high number of rockets indiscriminately launched by armed opposition groups on civilian areas of western Aleppo in the last 48 hours.” “Those who argue that this is meant to relieve the siege of eastern Aleppo should be reminded that nothing justifies the use of disproportionate, indiscriminate including heavy weapons on civilian areas,” Staffan de Mistura said. The actions \"could amount to war crimes,\" he warned. Government-held West Aleppo has been under constant fire from the rebel-controlled East for several weeks now with many civilians, including children, falling victim to the attacks. RT: Do you think there will be, at some point, an official investigation into human rights violations committed by rebel groups as they continue with their attacks on western Aleppo? Jim Jatras: Well, there certainly should be and the question whether they will be is very difficult to answer because, remember, these are groups supported by the US and other Western countries and by our allies in the region - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so forth. Despite the fact that these are terrorist groups, that they are Al-Qaeda and their various allies, and they are very reluctant to put a spotlight on the kind of people that we’re supporting in this region. Let’s remember, a couple of months ago the Al-Zinki group was alleged of using chlorine gas. And the State Department spokesman was asked, ‘if we were shown [that] they used chlorine gas, would we drop our support for them?’ And he refused to answer. So I’m afraid we’re going to see a roadblock put in by Western governments to avoid that kind of investigation. RT: If they continue to commit what may amount to war crimes, could the rebels lose Western support? In terms of public opinion, is there any chance we\\'ll start seeing a shift in attitude toward armed opposition groups in Syria? JJ: It is certainly out of the bag for people who watch RT and who tune into alternative media. But as far as the American mainstream media goes, it is not out of the bag at all. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups. I would be very interested to see in the very next couple of days, will the American and other Western European mainstream media report this and pin the blame where it belongs - on these terrorists and on the governments that are supporting them. RT: Are the attacks and potential war crimes receiving sufficient coverage to sway public opinion? JJ: Absolutely not. These attacks are not new, these attacks against West Aleppo have been going on continuously and they receive zero reporting in the Western media. I monitor the American media pretty closely, and look at the double standards on how they report on say the offensive against Mosul versus the offensive against East Aleppo. They are night and day difference and I have not heard any reports of terrorist attacks on West Aleppo in the American media. RT: In their latest assault, it appears the rebels used chlorine gas. Where are they likely to have acquired such weapons or the materials required for their assembly? JJ: We’ve had a couple of instances with sarin, for example. There have been allegations in the past that this has been done inside Turkey. I am not in a position to verify that, but given that that’s the main route of the supply for the terrorists, that would be a reasonable speculation to start with. Moderate radical groups are like a Trojan Horse that Western countries and the Gulf States put inside Syria, says Dr. Said Sadiq, professor of political sociology at the American University of Cairo. RT: Staffan de Mistura has condemned the rebel’s actions in Aleppo. Will Western politicians and media now shift their attention to the atrocities the rebels are committing? Dr. Said Sadiq: Despite the fact that not Mistura alone but also the UN Secretary General also condemned what is happening, but all Western media attention is going now to the battle of Mosul in Iraq and what is happening in Aleppo is being sidestepped and played down in international media… RT: Today there was a chemical gas attack in western Aleppo. Will the West reassess its support for these so called moderate groups if it is confirmed the rebels conducted it? SS: We have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf States invested in those moderate radical groups and so they cannot abandon them. They are like the Trojan Horse that they had put inside the Syrian domestic situation. They cannot pull out now and say: “Okay, we discovered that we were wrong, let’s get out and leave them.” They have invested in them and they will still use them in bargaining in the future of Syria. So, if there are any future negotiations on the fate of Syria, those people, these cards of radicals and moderates will be used on the negotiating table. I don’t think that they will get rid of them soon. Secondly, how did they get all those chemical weapons? The Gulf States provide weapons but they don’t have chemicals. So, most likely the chemical weapons had come from a NATO country. Because these are the only countries that have such kind of weapons. How did these chemical weapons come to the Syrian rebels? You will have the usual suspect –Turkey. You would not know from the US mainstream media that we’re supporting terrorists in East Aleppo, that it was Al-Qaeda and other groups.\\xa0 RT: The UK plans to launch a new program to train rebels and supply them with weapons. Last year a similar program was a complete failure and ended up with the rebels fighting alongside ISIS and Al-Nusra. Will the same happen again? SS: Six years of wasted resources and money to destroy Syria and they failed. The objective that was declared: “We will topple the Assad regime.” Six years and nothing happened. Do you think that one more year or more investment will tip the iceberg and change what we have seen? I doubt it. I think it was wasted money and they had one strategic aim: They don’t want the gas coming from Qatar to cross Syria to Europe and also to destroy the Syrian society, not the Syrian regime, Syrian society, the Syrian army, Syrian territorial integrity.

              "  '“For us this is a very sensitive topic – today our Western partners start discussions about additional deployment of troops to countries that are our neighbors,” RIA Novosti quoted Vladimir Makey as saying on Monday, after the talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “This causes our concern, we see this as a potential challenge to our nation.” READ MORE: ‘Ludicrous to believe NATO missile defense in Eastern Europe not targeting Russia’ Makey also said that Russia and Belarus would jointly develop “adequate reactive measures” both to additional deployment of conventional troops to Eastern Europe and putting elements of the US global missile defense system in the proximity to Russian and Belarus borders. The minister reminded the press that his country and the Russian Federation have formed a Union State and continue to develop close ties in the military sphere. Putting additional troop in the European region only added up to tensions and damaged the universal security, he said. Last week NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg took part in the inauguration ceremony of the US Aegis Ashore anti-missile station in Romania. Stoltenberg mentioned in his speech that the facility does not pose any threat to the Russian Federation, but this statement was immediately questioned by Russian politicians and officials. “We have been saying right from when this story started that our experts are convinced that the deployment of the ABM system poses a certain threat to the Russian Federation,” President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"Measures are being taken to ensure the necessary level of security for Russia. The president himself, let me remind you, has repeatedly asked who the system will work against [if not Russia].” READ MORE: ‘Certainly it’s a threat’: Moscow rejects NATO claims ABM site safe for Russia The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\\'s Department for Proliferation and Arms Control Issues, Mikhail Ulyanov, told reporters last week that the move had an adverse effect on strategic stability, adding that the direct interests of Russia’s security are affected by this event. He added that by launching the Romanian base the United States violated the 1987 INF treaty under which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed their respective countries up to obligations “not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500km to 5,500km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.” Also last week the US commenced the construction of an ABM site in Poland, due to be ready by late 2018.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'Police didn’t properly classify crimes involving rape up to 2014, with about 700 cases containing allegations of sexual abuse remaining unattributed to this category every year. The average number of rape cases annually registered by police was nearly half that figure at 395, according to the Justice Ministry’s investigation, Metroxpress\\xa0reports. The majority of unrecorded rape incidents ended up as cases with inconclusive evidence, as there were doubts whether rapes had been committed. This approach to statistics was dropped in November 2015, but still an unknown number of cases are not reflected in the data.The Justice Ministry says the real number of rape cases totals an average of 1,100 a year. “It is a huge number, but it doesn’t surprise me that the actual number is higher than the official one,” Hanne Baden Nielsen, director of the Center for Sexual Assault, said describing the revelations as “astonishing.” Her comments were reported by The Local. Danish nightspots bar migrants by introducing ‘language controls’ https://t.co/uvOYkU1EZCpic.twitter.com/Av5QOhG64I Pernille Skipper, a Danish MP, blamed the police for mishandling sexual abuse cases. “Unfortunately, this reflects what we are hearing from women that tell us that the police are sending them home,” she said. However, Soren Pind, Denmark`s Justice Minister, denied that the incorrect data was a result of an intentional cover-up and stressed the need to improve the accuracy of statistics. “I don’t think anyone in the system actually wanted to hide these things,” she told Metroexpress, adding that the authorities intend to monitor the police’s actions in this area more closely. “We are bringing in a monitoring of this area. If any case is suspended, reasons must be given, so now we will get a useful statistic.” On Wednesday, a Danish teenage girl was sexually assaulted by an English-speaking man in the center of the small town of Sonderborg . The attacker knocked her down and was about to assault her when she used pepper spray to defend herself, forcing him to flee the scene. However, police charged her with possessing a weapon, saying it is illegal to carry and use pepper sprays, according to reports in local media. Earlier, it was reported that women were subject to harassment by asylum seekers in at least three Danish cities. Several incidents occurred in the town of Thisted, where a refugee camp for 365 asylum seekers is located. Cases of sexual abuse were also registered in the Danish cities of Sonderborg and Hardeslev, where several local nightspots owners imposed “language controls” requiring visitors to prove their ability to speak Danish, German or French, following complaints from women. Since 551 women reported being sexual harassed on New Year’s Eve in the German city of Cologne, allegedly committed by groups of migrants of North African origin, the problem of sexually-related violence in Europe has been in the media spotlight.

              "  'Australian archaeologist Damian Evans’ findings, which are due to be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science on Monday, detail the scale of the discovery surrounding the temples of Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world.\\xa0 Phnom Hub in site Kulen National park 2016 06 08 pic.twitter.com/SsAxtroFtv Cutting-edge laser technology, known as Lidar, which is fired from a helicopter into the ground, penetrating through forests, was used to produce detailed imagery of the Earth’s surface. It revealed a network of ancient cities between 900 and 1,400 years old, with some as big as Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh, according to The Guardian. The data, captured in 2015, suggests the Khmer empire would have been the largest in the world during the 12 century.\\xa0 Evans first carried out a light detection and ranging study in 2012, and the project received funding from the European Research Council as a result.\\xa0 The 2012 study revealed connections between Angkor Wat and other temple cities like Koh Ker. It also confirmed the presence of Mahendraparvata, a city beneath Mount Kulen, and the more recent survey revealed the scale of that city. Water systems were also discovered, which shows the technology was used hundreds of years earlier than previously believed.\\xa0 David Chandler, emeritus professor at Monash University in Melbourne and one of the leading experts on Cambodian history, described the findings as “game-changing,” saying it had succeeded in “putting hundreds of nameless, ordinary, Khmer-speaking people back into Cambodia’s past.” The new discovery also debunks a previously held theory that suggested the Khmer had fled from the area when the Thais invaded in the 15th Century. “That didn’t happen, there are no cities [revealed by the aerial survey] that they fled to. It calls into question the whole notion of an Angkorian collapse,” Evans said. A sample of the kind of imagery now coming online from the 2015 Cambodian lidar campaign: https://t.co/AxwidYqnCGpic.twitter.com/ZNYUB9dK1B South-East Asia’s leading archaeologist, Charles Higham, a professor at Dunedin’s University of Otago in New Zealand, summed up the discovery, “Personally, it is wonderful to be alive as these new discoveries are being made. Emotionally, I am stunned. Intellectually, I am stimulated.” Although the collected data will take years to fully analyze, the discovery is sure to reveal more about the Khmer empire and provide a boost to Cambodian tourism. Angkor Wat is Cambodia’s main tourist attraction, but the vast archaeological park located in Siem Reap has experienced a stagnation in ticket sales in 2016, the Phnom Penh Post reports.\\xa0 ',\n",

Experts say the Chinese are using the digital currency as a way to circumvent capital controls. “There is a premium in bitcoin pricing in China as a hedge against the yuan,\" Jack Liu, the Hong Kong-based chief strategy officer at OKCoin told Bloomberg. “Strength is likely to carry into year-end.\" China accounts for about 90 percent of all bitcoin trading on exchanges. The country has strict capital controls, which makes it difficult for the Chinese to convert the yuan into foreign currency, and limits the amount of cash investors can move abroad.

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  '“The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,” Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, adding that it was done deliberately and on purpose. “This idea was planted into the US public consciousness… with only one goal… to protect the interests of the Democratic candidate in her competition with the candidate of the Republicans, in this case – with Mr. Trump,” the Russian president stressed. The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. “The ‘Russian card’ has been used to demonize one particular candidate – to tie him with Russia, which is not particularly popular in the US at the moment and therefore to diminish his prospects,” former British diplomat Alastair Crooke told RT. He also warned that the deliberate “demonization of Russia in every aspect” used as a political tool during the US presidential campaign will have “a substantive long-term effect on the relations, whoever will be president.” “It will make it very, very difficult for [the future US president] to start a new relationship with the Russian president afterwards,” Crooke stressed. His words were partly echoed by writer John Wight, who told RT that accusing Russia of meddling with the US election process on behalf of Donald Trump is “reckless and very dangerous because whoever will be the next president, he or she is going to deal with Russia.” At the same time, Wight stressed, “it is in the interest of the US people as well as of the people of the whole world that the US reset relations with Russia.” Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters\\' hearts,\" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. “He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin.

              "  'The official entry was made Saturday, bringing to a close, at least partially, Beijing’s years-long struggle for international acceptance on the sort of level enjoyed by the US dollar. The currency now joins the big four: the US dollar, the euro, the yen, and the British pound. The decision means the Chinese yuan will now be used as one of the International Monetary Fund’s lending currencies in times of emergency economic bailouts. This sort of internationalization is in line with China’s wish for increased legitimacy of its currency. The move is also evidence of China’s growing role as a power to challenge the global economic dominance of the United States. The limitations China places on its own markets, however, have themselves been to blame for this delayed outcome. “It’s an irreversible path towards opening up, integrating into the global economy and playing the economic game by the rules,” proclaimed IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. READ MORE: Putin’s gift to Xi causes Russian ice cream craze in China Her assurance comes as critics say the move is no more than symbolic. Many of them accuse Beijing of exchange rate manipulations and cross-border capital movements. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said China is still “quite a ways” away from the status of a true global reserve currency. Nevertheless, the IMF said it recognizes the “enormous” changes made over the past decade to bring yuan out into the open. On Friday, the IMF fixed the relative amounts of the five main currencies in its basket for five years, based on the exchange rate of each one over the last three months. ',\n",

              "  'business',\n",
              "  'The new delivery method for the freshest possible produce is being pioneered by\\xa0INFARM which is currently testing its live herb gardens at METRO stores in Berlin. The people behind the project say these are the first indoor farming installations of their kind, placed directly in supermarkets. \"Imagine a future where cities become self-sufficient in their food production, where autonomous farms grow fresh premium produce at affordable prices, eliminating waste and environmental impact,\" INFARM says. The farms look like a tiny greenhouse inside the store where shoppers can pick their own freshly harvested salad greens and herbs right from the growing plants. The advantages of the indoor micro-farms are lower transport costs and associated emissions. They use less water, energy and space than conventional farms and horizontal greenhouses. The vertical greenhouses currently grow only herbs and salad greens but the company says they can be reconfigured to growing other crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and others. INFARM’s Berlin pilot program with vertical mini-farms will end in six months after which the company plans expanding into other supermarket locations. It is also considering putting similar modules into restaurants and hotels which want to offer something unique to their clients and guests. INFARM began several years ago as an indoor urban farming startup with an origami-inspired micro-garden project. Today, the company says \"Our farms are a perfect synergy between hardware and software, creating far greater production efficiency than any other technology in the market.\" ',\n",

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  'WADA says athletes who are found to have less than 1 mcg of meldonium in doping tests carried out before March 1, 2016, could be allowed to compete again. Tennis player Maria Sharapova and swimmer Yulia Efimova were two of around 40 Russian athletes who failed drug tests for meldonium.\\xa0 “If the anti-doping organization finds that the athlete could not reasonably have known or suspected that the substance would still be present in his/her body on or after 1 January 2016, then a finding of no fault or negligence may be made,” a press release\\xa0from WADA stated.\\xa0 However, WADA said this was not an “amnesty,” rather it was an acceptance that organizations should take occurrences on a case by case basis. \"In no way does this serve as an \\'amnesty\\' for athletes that are asserted to have committed an anti-doping rule violation,\" WADA spokesman Ben Nichols told AP in an email. \"Rather, it serves as guidance for how anti-doping organizations should assess the particular circumstances of each individual case under their jurisdiction.\"\\xa0 In the statement, WADA admitted that more tests need to be carried out to find out how long meldonium can remain in the blood stream, a point which has been argued by Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko.\\xa0 “In the case of meldonium, there is currently a lack of clear scientific information on excretion times. For this reason, a hearing panel might justifiably find (unless there is specific evidence to the contrary) that an athlete who has established, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she ingested meldonium before 1 January 2016, could not reasonably have known or suspected the meldonium would still be present in his or her body on or after 1 January 2016. In these circumstances, WADA considers there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,” the statement continued.\\xa0 WADA can confirm there have been 172 Adverse Analytical Findings (positives) for Meldonium since it was banned on 1st January 2016 #WADA Athletes around the world were told meldonium was to be added to WADA’s list of banned substances in September 2015, while the ban came into effect on January 1, 2016.\\xa0 One of those who is set to gain from WADA’s decision is Sharapova. She said she had been taking meldonium for more than a decade because of health problems and was provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in March after announcing she had failed a test at the Australian Open in Melbourne. However, the Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev said Sharapova’s ban could be addressed in a meeting with ITF head David Haggerty later this month. “The situation with Sharapova could be resolved after April 21 when we meet with the head of the international federation. After that all should be become clear. It is too early to talk about Sharapova competing at the Olympic Games,” TASS quoted Tarpishchev as saying, as cited by Reuters. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was happy that WADA had been flexible regarding meldonium in a statement on its website, as cited by TASS.\\xa0 “The Russian Sports Ministry supports and welcomes the decision made by WADA because it has showed a willingness to understand the situation, rather than stick to the rulebook. They were ready to study how long it would take for meldonium to be eliminated from the body of an athlete. WADA has sent recommendations to all the anti-doping organizations, which will allow them to make fair decisions based on the actual guilt of an athlete. In doing so, WADA has demonstrated impartiality and being objective in the fight against doping.”\\xa0 The five-time speed skating world champion Pavel Kulizhnikov and the 2014 Olympic short track gold medalist Semen Elistratov are two athletes who are set to benefit from WADA’s ruling, and the president of the Russian Speed Skating Union Aleksey Kravtsov told R-Sport that the pair should be allowed to compete again.\\xa0 “These sportsmen should be allowed to fall under the amnesty due to the amount found in their doping tests. They were not guilty, as we had been saying earlier. This is of course good news, but there is still a bit of a cloud hanging over all of this,” he said. ',\n",

If a foreign-based hosting company refuses to remove the content after receiving the request to do so by Russian authorities, its whole address is blocked in Russia. The law also reads that blocked websites should be unblocked immediately after the content deemed to be illegal is removed. ',\n",

              "  'usa',\n",
              "  ' From Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, this Sunday, October 9 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, the major political party nominees for president face off for the second time. There will be a first time face-off as well, with undecided voters challenging the candidates on the issues. Again organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, this event will differ in several ways from the first debate a worldwide audience witnessed less than two weeks ago. Not only will the audience, chosen by the Gallup Organization, be asking half of all the questions, but there will be two moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News, instead of just one to handle the remainder. READ MORE: Top GOPers urge Trump to quit race amid tape scandal  Like the previous debate, this one will run for 90 minutes without any breaks. It will be aired on all the top networks except for NBC, which will be presenting NFL football, a serious competitor for viewers. As of Friday, the Real Clear Politics average of national election polls dated back to September 26 shows Clinton leading Trump by four-and-a-half points, 48.3 to 43.8 percent. And no, the third-party presidential candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein, did not improve their numbers to the level the debate commission requires for a spot in the debate. In polls released Friday from Quinnipiac and Rasmussen, Johnson was at 6 and 7 percent, while Dr. Stein garnered 3 and 2 percent, respectively. READ MORE: ‘I’m kind of far removed’: Clinton admits estrangement from middle class in Wall Street paid speech However, since Friday both candidates have been marred with separate scandals:\\xa0 Hillary\\'s leaked\\xa0Wall St. speech in which she claimed her and Bill\\'s \"fortunes\" allowed them to \"enjoy\" a lifestyle \"far removed\" from the middle class, and Trump\\'s 2005 hot mic \"Grab them by the p***y\" bombshell\\xa0could have a significant impact on poll numbers. This unpredictable election cycle continues to heat up, and the rules of the campaign trail are still being rewritten. Sometimes whole new roads to the White House come under construction without warning. One example is the state of North Dakota, long considered a safe haven for Republican presidential candidates. That red state, however, seems to be veering toward battleground status, as RT\\'s Ed Schultz hosted a political town hall in Fargo on Thursday night. The candidates are expected to address some of the most important issues facing America, such as climate change, gun control and social security, but don\\'t be surprised if Trump\\'s stance on women (i.e. hot mic) and Clinton\\'s never-ending\\xa0email debacle\\xa0are brought up too.\\xa0 “I hope that unlike the first debate, there\\'s actually real discussion over things Americans care about,” Ryan Girdusky of RedAlertPolitics.com told RT on Friday. But he isn’t holding his breath. “I think Trump is going to be a lot more of an attack dog. I think there\\'s going to be a lot more training under [vice presidential running mate] Mike Pence and consultation under [campaign manager] Kellyanne [Conway].” “And I think what Hillary is going to do is try to stick to the Clinton playbook of make Trump go down a rabbit hole,” Girdusky added. “Talk about his taxes, talk about his affairs, his relationships, talk about his money, talk about his hair, who knows, but get him away from the issues.” READ MORE: \\'Clinton campaign blames Russian hackers as Assange promises more leaks\\' Whatever happens Sunday night, it will determine how much momentum each candidate has with the homestretch in sight. The election will be just four weeks away, with the final debate taking place Wednesday, October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. According\\xa0to a Politico report,\\xa0Clinton is by far best positioned to steer the direction of the final days of the presidential race. Her campaign and affiliated accounts have $150 million on hand as of early October, in addition to $80 million already set aside for TV ads as well as more money for direct voter outreach. The report calculates the Clinton camp can afford to spend almost $5 million every single day ahead of November 8, and that does not count the Democratic National Committee coffers of around $11.5 million, from September reports, or the Priorities USA Action Super PAC, which began September with $40 million. The real estate tycoon, however, reported just $38 million at the start of September, compared to the Republican National Committee with $40.5 million, Politico reported. Other committees supporting Trump have not reported their totals since July. ',\n",

              "  'UPDATE: Baton Rouge shooter identified as former marine, reportedly ex-Nation of Islam member The attack was a lone-wolf incident, Colonel Mike Edmondson, the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police said at the press conference following the incident, according to Reuters. The active shooter situation declared in Baton Rouge on Sunday has come to an end, the gunman is dead, he added. \"We do not have an active shooter scenario in Baton Rouge,\" Edmonson said. Louisiana authorities will hold another press conference regarding the Baton Rouge shootings at 1pm CDT (1800 GMT) on Monday, Reuters reported. According to earlier reports, police believed there could have been at least two more suspects on the loose. Three officers out of five transported to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital have died from their injuries. Two others remain in hospital, with one being in fair condition and the other in a critical state, according to WAFB and Reuters.\\xa0The condition of the third policeman transported to the hospital remains unknown. The Baton Rouge police department reportedly used\\xa0a robot to check the area for explosive devices.\\xa0 “We do know, and do believe there are more than one suspect. That’s why we’re alerting the community. We sending in the robot to see if there are any explosives in the area or any explosives on him,” said Corporal L’Jean McKneely, WAFB reported. Two of the officers killed were from the Baton Rouge police, and the third was an East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s deputy, Baton Rouge Chief Administrative Officer William Daniel said earlier, as cited by The Advocate. The shooting took place at the B-Quik convenience store at a gas station, Baton Rouge police said, according to AP. The body of the suspect was found outside the store, at the door of a nearby fitness club. The city was\\xa0on high alert following the incident. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Casey Rayborn Hicks said earlier\\xa0that one gunman had been killed, and\\xa0police believed two more shooters may have been at large. WAFB said\\xa0that the shootout began in the early hours of Sunday morning on Airline Highway near Old Hammond Highway in Baton Rouge, less than one mile from police headquarters.\\xa0 Police reportedly have no clear picture on what started the shooting, but it seems there was a running gun fight in the area of the shopping center and convenience store. They were first notified of the incident at about 8:45 a.m. Sunday. Baton Rouge police responded to a call reporting a “suspicious person walking down Airline Highway with an assault rifle,”\\xa0a CNN source said, adding that the person opened fire as soon as the police squad arrived. According to a witness, there were at least 25-30 gunshots heard before police arrived, WAFB reported. Police officers were probably not the initial target, another witness said. \"This was not a come at police shooting.

The attack follows the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old black man, Alton Sterling, by two white police officers in Baton Rouge earlier in July. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake responded to a call that a man was allegedly using a gun to threaten another man outside a convenience store. Following the arrival of the police, Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point-blank range. The two officers, who are both currently suspended, claimed Sterling reached for a gun before being shot at by law enforcers. In a video recording of the incident, one of the officers, presumably Salamoni, shouted “He’s got a gun! Gun!” prompting his partner to pull out his service pistol and fire several shots. The US Department of Justice is leading a criminal investigation into the case, joined by the FBI and state police of Louisiana. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Baton Rouge Police Department over the response to the protests that followed. “The lawsuit alleges that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to disperse protesters who were gathered peacefully to speak out against the police killing of Alton Sterling,” the ACLU said in a statement. The shooting led to massive protests against police violence in the US. One of the demonstrations spilled into yet more bloodshed. Five officers were killed in Dallas on July 7 while guarding a rally against excessive use of force by police. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Micah Johnson, used a sniper rifle while targeting officers in what was reported to be a revenge attack for police killings of black people. \"We\\'re convinced that this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous and believed that he was going to target law enforcement – make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement\\'s efforts to punish people of color,\" Dallas Police Chief David said following the incident. Following a standoff with law enforcers Johnson was shot dead. He had served as a reservist in the army until April 2015 and was also deployed to Afghanistan from November 2003 to July 2014. Officials noted that they did not believe the man was part of a terrorist organization and that the assault was a lone-wolf attack. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  ' “This is political rhetoric that does not have great significance and does not take into account the real situation in Syria,” Putin told French TV channel TF1 during an interview in the central Russian city of Kovrov, when asked about the accusations that have been leveled by Francois Hollande, UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, and the Obama administration. Putin then accused the West of destabilizing the region – citing the Arab Spring in 2011 as a key flashpoint for tensions that still dominate the Muslim world. “I believe deeply that some of the responsibility for what is happening in the region in general and in Syria in particular lies especially with our western partners, above all the USA and its allies, including the main European countries,” said Putin. “Remember how everyone rushed to support the Arab Spring? Where is that optimism now? How did it all end? Remember what Libya or Iraq looked like before these countries and their organizations were destroyed as states by our western partners’ forces?” Putin linked the volatility in the region to the recent spate of large-scale terrorist attacks in the West, which have either been planned or inspired by jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have thrived in the chaos. “[Before the Arab Spring] these Middle Eastern countries were not examples of democracies as we understand the word today, and there probably was a need and possibility to influence these societies’ organization, the state organization, and the nature of these regimes,” said Putin, who was attending a festival dedicated to Sambo, a Russian combat sport. “But whatever the case, these states showed no signs of terrorism. They were not a threat for Paris, for the Cote d’Azur, for Belgium, for Russia, or for the United States. Now, they are the source of terrorist threats. Our goal is to prevent the same from happening in Syria.” Putin also detailed his version of the breakdown of the long-negotiated joint operation between Washington and Moscow in Syria, claiming the key turning point was the September 16 US-led coalition strike on a Syrian army unit, which the Pentagon maintains was accident. “Our American colleagues told us that this airstrike was made in error. This error cost the lives of 80 people and, also just coincidence, perhaps, ISIS took the offensive immediately afterwards. At the same time, lower down the ranks, at the operations level, one of the American military service personnel said quite frankly that they spent several days preparing this strike. How could they make an error if they were several days in preparation?” said Putin. “This is how our ceasefire agreement ended up broken. Who broke the agreement? Was it us? No.” Several western powers have since blamed Russia for what they claim was a retaliatory strike on a UN convoy on September 20. Washington has now broken off any bilateral talks with Moscow over Syria. But Putin says that Russia is still open to helping resolve what the UN has termed the worst humanitarian crisis since the war – which has likely killed over 400,000 people – began five years ago. “It has been proposed that our armed units, Russian military personnel, be deployed on the road to ensure transit safety [for aid convoys to Aleppo]. The Russian military, who are courageous and decisive people, have said they would do it,” said Putin, who said that the initiative, which had not previously been made public, was an “exotic proposal.” “But I told them that this could only be done jointly with the US, and ordered them to make the proposal. We have proposed this, and they [the Americans] promptly refused. They do not want to deploy their troops there, but they also do not want to pull back opposition groups – who are, in fact, terrorists. What can we do in this situation?” Despite the downbeat tone of the interview, Putin insisted he was still “optimistic” about a diplomatic solution in Syria, and claimed that the offer to “reschedule” next week’s visit to France, which was canceled following a diplomatic snub by Francois Hollande, was genuine. “This is not the best moment for official meetings, given the lack of mutual understanding, to put it mildly, that we have over events in Syria, particularly the situation in Aleppo. But we are always open, of course, to any consultations and dialogue on this matter,” said Putin. WATCH MORE:  ',\n",

I think that special services from across the ocean are dealing with these issues, destabilizing the situation in these countries,” the deputy chair of the State Duma Committee for Eurasian Integration and Commonwealth of Independent States, Kazbek Taisayev, told Life news portal.The MP said that Western nations were not interested in a calm situation near Russian borders and took steps to prevent such developments. “As soon as we start a normal dialogue with our neighbors, something immediately happens in these countries,” he said. “We need to unite our efforts, I think that we have enough political will to render mutual help to poor nations,” Taisayev stated. The comment came shortly after a group of radical nationalists stormed and captured a police station in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan, killing one policeman and taking several more hostage. The attackers demanded the release of Armenian opposition figure Jirayr Sefilyan, who was detained last month after authorities reportedly uncovered a plot to seize several buildings and telecommunication facilities in Yerevan.

A large group of military officers attempted to seize power, displacing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, their plans were thwarted by police and thousands of ordinary people who took to the streets of Ankara and Istanbul. According to Turkish authorities 246 government supporters and at least 24 coup plotters were killed during the conflict. Thousands of Turkish military and law enforcement personnel were arrested and fired in the large-scale purge that followed these events. On Wednesday, Erdogan announced the introduction of a state of emergency in Turkey for three months.

From a further 265 tests conducted recently, the IOC has announced that 23 competitors from six countries have failed, with the focus on athletes that could potentially be set to compete in Brazil. IOC President Thomas Bach used this latest evidence of doping as a way to show that the organization is committed to stamping out illegal substance usage in the sport. \"These re-analyses show, once again, our determination in the fight against doping,\" he said. \"We want to keep the dopers away from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. “This is why we are acting swiftly now. I have already appointed a disciplinary commission, which has the full power to take all the decisions on behalf of the IOC.” The names or nationalities of those set to be implicated in the positive tests have not yet been revealed. The news follows on from 454 retrospective tests on samples from athletes that competed in Beijing in 2008, with 31 positive results revealed last week. A total of 14 of these new failures have been attributed to Russian athletes, with the threat that a number could have their medals stripped and given to other competitors.

              "  'news',\n",
              "  'Ankara has demanded to have comedian Jan Boehmermann prosecuted for insulting a foreign head of state.\\xa0 Under a section of Germany\\'s criminal code, the government has to authorize prosecutors to pursue a case against the comedian. The code, known as Paragraph 103, concerns insults against organs or representatives of foreign states. However, it is so rarely used that many German politicians and lawyers were previously unaware of its existence. \"Turkey has demanded prosecution of Jan Boehmermann. [The] German government, in accordance with established practice, studied the note; this process involved the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Office of the Federal Chancellor. As a result, the federal government in regard to this incident, satisfies the request,\" Merkel told reporters\\xa0at the\\xa0Chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor went on to stress that it \"means\\xa0neither a prejudgment of the person affected nor a decision about the limits of freedom of art, the press and opinion.\" Merkel said that the government intends to repeal the law, effective in 2018.\\xa0 \"There were different opinions between the coalition partners - the conservatives and the SPD (Social Democrats),\" Merkel added. On Friday, German politicians from the “Green” party criticized Merkel\\'s decision to satisfy Ankara’s request, branding it a political mistake. “I believe Merkel’s decision is a political mistake. She has set up a trap for herself by politicizing the case, now she has to live with the accusation that the deal with Turkey [over the refugee crisis] became more important to her than freedom of speech,” Anton Hofreiter, head of the Green party, told TV channel N24. “Merkel should have made it clear from the start that we in Germany have a free press, while Erdogan should take better care of the press at home.” The head of the Social Democratic Party, Thomas Operman, also condemned Merkel’s move.\\xa0 “This decision is wrong. Prosecution of satire due to “lese-majeste” does not correspond with modern democracy,\" Operman wrote on Twitter. The German Union of Journalists (DJV) in their turn said such measures proposed by the chancellor do not correspond with German laws, adding that Merkel gave the “wrong signals” on the case to the Turkish government. “There was no need for the decision since the Turkish president has already filed a complaint to the Mainz Prosecutor.” On Monday, Erdogan filed a private lawsuit before sending a note to the German government demanding criminal prosecution of the presenter. Boehmermann read the\\xa0poem on Germany\\'s ZDF television two weeks ago. Although the\\xa0broadcaster withdrew the piece from its archives,\\xa0it said that no laws were broken. However, Boehmermann warned ahead of time that the reading would breach regulation on insulting foreign leaders.\\xa0 The Turkish government says the poem accused Erdogan of\\xa0“repressing minorities, kicking Kurds, and slapping Christians while watching child porn.” Turkey\\'s own press freedom has come under serious attack in recent months, including from Germany.\\xa0 In March, Ankara reportedly\\xa0pressured\\xa0Berlin into removing a satirical clip aired by public broadcaster NDR, which criticized the president for his crackdown on freedom of speech, as well as the alleged shuffling of electorate votes and cracking down on women. Earlier that month,\\xa0a correspondent for Germany\\'s Der Spiegel magazine was forced\\xa0to leave Turkey after his press credentials weren\\'t removed. The publication\\'s editor-in-chief accused Ankara of violating press freedom. Also last month, employees of Turkey\\'s Zaman newspaper said\\xa0they “feel like captives” following the government\\'s takeover of the daily. Since the paper\\'s seizure, it has has turned into a government mouthpiece, with the first edition under the new ownership immediately featuring a picture of Erdogan.\\xa0 Meanwhile, two journalists from Turkey\\'s Cumhuriyet newspaper are being charged with espionage after publishing a report in 2014 which purported to show Turkey\\'s state intelligence agency helping to transfer weapons into Syria by truck. The two spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the Constitutional Court ruled in February that their pre-trial detention was a violation of their rights. The journalists\\' detainment prompted criticism from international human rights groups, as well as from the EU and US Vice President Joe Biden, who said that Turkey was setting a poor example for the region by intimidating the media. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu previously stated that the two journalists should be released from prison ahead of the trial. ',\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"The vast majority of the country's citizens disagree with Merkel’s refugee policy, according to the\\xa0poll conducted last weekend. Asked whether “the federal government has the refugee situation under control,” 81 percent of Germans answered “No,” with just 18 percent saying “Yes.” Those answering “No” also included members of Merkel’s Christian Social Union, with a notable 67 percent of the party’s voters unhappy with the chancellor’s policies. Voter support for Merkel’s government dropped from 57 percent in July 2015 to 38 percent on February 2016 – “the worst estimate during the current government’s term,” the pollster said. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which advocates an anti-immigrant agenda became the third most influential party. It was projected to get 12 percent of the vote if the federal election were held this Sunday. Most Germans also think more restrictive measures towards refugees and asylum seekers must follow. A remarkable 88 percent believe the government should curb benefits for refugees who fail or are unwilling to integrate into German society, with 10 percent saying “No” – a measure previously announced by Germany’s Labor Minister Andrea Nahles. Introducing tougher border control on the EU’s external frontiers and a more detailed processing of asylum seeker applications, debated over the past months in Germany, was also widely supported. Some 63 percent said “Yes” to install the EU’s external border, while 33 percent were opposed. Consequently, 53 percent of Germans said border controls within EU countries – seen as threatening the Schengen border-free zone by many in Brussels – should be introduced as well. According to 77 percent of respondents Europe must also set up refugee centers at the EU’s external borders to process migrants’ applications and send back ineligible asylum seekers. The poll came alongside the so-called “Asylum package II” (Asylpaket II) – the newest set of measures by the German government designed to toughen refugee policies. The package includes putting limits on the number of asylum seekers admitted to Europe, and also an attempt to integrate those who have already reached Germany. Refugees will have to take integration courses, costing €10 a month. Germany accused of ‘paying’ African countries to take back ‘foreign’ asylum seekers https://t.co/TSsbzXu8rppic.twitter.com/auWTD38I0d Merkel’s government has come under fire for the chancellor’s “welcoming policy” towards refugees, who have recently arrived in Germany in overwhelming numbers. Although she says Germany can cope with the 1.1 million who have come in 2015 – and potentially more in 2016 – nearly 40 percent of Germans believe Merkel should step down over her refugee policy, according to January’s Insa\\xa0survey for Focus magazine. \",\n",

              "  'The 17-mile superconducting machine, designed to smash protons together at close to the speed of light, went offline late Thursday. \"Not the best week for LHC!\"\\xa0the summary of the incident report said.\\xa0 \"We had electrical problems, and we are pretty sure this was caused by a small animal,\" said Arnaud Marsollier, the head of press for CERN, the organization that runs the $7 billion particle collider in Switzerland. \"We are in the countryside, and of course we have wild animals everywhere,\" Marsollier continued, adding that the culprit was probably a weasel. The little critter caused a big disruption for the LHC. Putting the machine back online isn\\'t a simple fix and could take until mid-May. But hey – it\\'s not like the LHC was preparing to do anything important. It was merely getting ready to collect new data on the Higgs boson, a particle considered to be a cornerstone of the modern theory of particle physics. It\\'s not the first time that the LHC has suffered at the hands of animals. In 2009, a bird is believed to have dropped a baguette into the system’s machinery, causing an electrical short. When the LHC isn\\'t being shut down by mischievous critters, it focuses on solving the mystery of our universe, aiming to study a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang took place.

              "  \" The information about the S-300’s deployment was confirmed by ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. “Indeed, the Syrian Arab Republic received an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. This system is designed to ensure the safety of the naval base in [Syrian city of] Tartus and ships located in the coastal area [in Syria]…” he told the media. Konashenkov said it is unclear why the deployment of the missile system has created such a fuss\\xa0in the West. “The S-300 is a purely defensive system and poses no threat,” he said. He recalled that before the deployment of S-300, Russia had delivered Fort air defense missile systems to Syria. The statement comes after a report by Fox news that a Russian S-300 was deployed to Syria. The media cited three US officials who claimed that Moscow “continues to ramp up its military operations in Syria.” BREAKING: US suspends bilateral contact with Russia over Syria https://t.co/OpHCLJSMCEpic.twitter.com/7VNWOBdZXD In November 2015, Moscow deployed its newest S-400 air defense missile system to Khmeimim in Syria as part of a security boost following the downing of a Russian jet by Turkey near the border with that country. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the S-400 systems are not targeting Russia's partners, “with whom we fight terrorists in Syria together.” The S-400 is the most advanced anti-aircraft defense system in Russia. \",\n",

              "  'politics',\n",
              "  '“The idea of specialness, exceptionality and unique rights of the American state and American people has been used in US internal political rhetoric for quite a while, but in the recent years it is being actively and persistently offered in US foreign policy documents and public speeches on international politics delivered by US officials,” Judge Valery Zorkin said at the St Petersburg international legal forum on Thursday. READ MORE: ‘American exceptionalism’ hampers its war on terror – Lavrov “Any unbiased and educated person would see that this statement by Obama is an almost exact copy of leading politicians and propaganda specialists of the Third Reich, including Adolph Hitler… In essence, Obama is using the exact same thing that Nazi bosses said about the German exceptionalism when they started the world war,” he added. The judge also said that in his view the exceptionalism concept had direct influence on the modern US concepts of military planning and these concepts see the main objective of all activities as reaching such degree of military might that the United States remains out of reach of other nations, on land, sea, in air and in space. According to Zorkin, the same applies to the US doctrines on development of mass media and electronic communications – the US authorities see their goal as establishing absolute global domination of their country in the global information space. This idea also constantly appears in Obama’s public speeches. “Obama says that Americans and the USA are an exceptional people and an exceptional state and thus they can pretend for much more than any other people or state. In other words, he follows the plot of James Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ dystopia and, while formally not rejecting the principle of equality of sovereign states and peoples, fixed by the UN Charter, he still declares that Americans and America are ‘more equal’ than any other country and the rest of the planet’s population,” RIA Novosti quoted the judge as saying. Zorkin also told his colleague at the forum that he considered such approach to be a blatant violation of international legal norms. Russian politicians and officials have repeatedly addressed the topic of American exceptionalism when talking on bilateral relations with the US and of international politics in general. In particular, in mid-2015 President Vladimir Putin said in his speech before the UN General Assembly that attempts to influence internal politics of sovereign nations should not be tolerated regardless of where they are taking place and who are making such attempts. READ MORE: Violence instead of democracy: Putin slams ‘policies of exceptionalism and impunity’ in UN speech “It seems that some nations are not learning from others’ mistakes, but keep repeating them. The export of so-called ‘democratic’ revolutions continues.” Putin said. “I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, ‘Do you realize now what you have done?’” he said. “But I am afraid the question will hang in the air, because policies based on self-confidence and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.” ',\n",

              "  'After initially refusing to speak with reporters outside the luxurious, yet heavily-fortified Hotel Taschenbergpalais on Saturday, the PayPal co-founder finally took the bait and launched into a rant about libertarian ideology. Peter Thiel is a globalist Bilderberger. He didn\\'t go after Gawker because he believes in free speech or nationalism https://t.co/Oq7u4vaGXj While saying he feels “it’s always important to exchange views with people no matter what their perspectives are,” he added the caveat that they “need to be finding ways to talk to people where not everything is completely transparent.” While the official agenda for the three-day event has been released, those opposed to it have aired their unease at the way in which over 120 of the most powerful politicians, bankers, and industry leaders meet to discuss the “problems in our society,\" since it’s not clear what \"secret\" deals have been cut and later inflicted on people around the world who aren’t on the invite list. Bilderberg 2016: US election and refugees top of agenda at secret invite-only conference https://t.co/6fcRtaiuqxpic.twitter.com/Cfneh8A0yp “Libertarianism is not synonymous with radical transparency; that’s often an argument the Stasi would make in East Germany where everything had to be monitored by society,” Thiel said on Saturday. Wait doesn’t the NSA record everything? https://t.co/73zUAq5qMt Here\\'s a transcript of Peter Thiel\\'s response to @Lukewearechange re. #Bilderberg. Dense, problematic, fascinating.. pic.twitter.com/rcm7yqGNYk Peter Thiel says transparency is something the STASI would favor??! Favors secret meetings of Plutocrats? Just wow. https://t.co/q3Iq2qJcvK The irony of the statements weren\\'t missed by social media users, who were keen to note that Thiel sits on the board of directors at Facebook, a company renowned for its monitoring and monetization of its users’ data. Thiel defends secret Bilderberg talks, equating transparency and \"monitoring by society\" with communist oppression. https://t.co/na5dGSj62X The tech billionaire added: \"Often you have the best conversations in smaller groups where not everything is being monitored. That’s how you have very honest conversations and you can think better about the future.” This echoes similar comments from Thiel who, in 2009, wrote an essay entitled, \"The Education of a Libertarian” in which he admitted he “no longer believe[s] that freedom and democracy are compatible.” Thiel made headlines last month when he was outed as Hulk Hogan’s “secret” funding source for his lawsuit against Gawker, which caused the media organization to file for bankruptcy this week. READ MORE: Gawker files for bankruptcy after Hulk Hogan verdict, will be auctioned off His legal action was in response to a long-standing battle with the online publisher that started with their 2007 \"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\" Much like his views on “radical transparency,\" the lawsuit centered around privacy, free speech, and free press with Hogan ultimately winning $140 million in damages. Billionaire funding Hulk Hogan\\'s lawsuit against Gawker https://t.co/murR6wLyFJpic.twitter.com/EXhlMHugY8 You may hate Gawker, but if you cheer Thiel\\'s successful vendetta you also don\\'t care much for freedom of expression. A terrible precedent. You can bet he won\\'t be the last billionaire who will try to bleed a news org into bankruptcy https://t.co/Z8V8VEgG2h So many wealthy people must be looking at what Thiel did to Gawker & wondering how they can sue media companies they dislike into bankruptcy To ensure privacy at Bilderberg, organizers brought in Germany’s military and “corporate security from Airbus” to oversee event security, the Guardian\\xa0reported Army officers working alongside a private company got conspiracy theory websites all worked up, with one reporter from Infowars spotting what he believed to be “numerous vans, full of federal police covering their faces, carrying in bags full of weapons.” Thiel isn’t the only Silicon Valley investor at Bilderberg, but he is the only vocal supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump/Thiel 2016 If it’s okay for Peter Thiel to fund the demise of Gawker, it’s okay for Trump to fund the demise of a legit journalistic institution. The one Republican elected official at the conference, Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, previously suggested one of Bilderberg’s main talking points would be “how to beat Trump” and has issues with his party’s presumptive nominee.\\xa0 Ultra Rich in America starting to bug me: Elizabeth Holmes, Peter Thiel, Travis Kalanik, Trump -- y\\'all been pushing your luck lately.

              "  'sport',\n",
              "  \"Popular among fans, the 3-on-3 format for overtime periods was adopted by the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2015-2016 season, replacing the 4-on-4 format that the league had been using since the 1999-2000 season. Before that, overtime periods were played by the whole lines, with three forwards and two defensemen. The reduction of the number of skaters on the ice creates more open spaces, which allows players to get into the attacking zone easier and place more shots on the net, and significantly increases the chances to score. “The decision was unanimous,” said KHL President Dmitry Chernyshenko, TASS reported. “That format is used around the world, all around Europe. Hockey will become more entertaining.” The innovation will be also adopted by the Russian-based Junior Hockey League (MHL) and Women's Hockey League (WHL). The new format will, however, only be used in the regular season. “In the regular season overtimes will be played in the 3-on-3 format, in the playoffs in the 5-on-5 format,” the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's first vice-president, Roman Rotenberg, told TASS. \",\n",

              "  'news',\n",
              "  \"The ongoing large-scale Anakonda-16 NATO military maneuvers in Poland, simulating the repulsion of “Russian aggression” against the country, are counterproductive, Deutsche Welle cited German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper, in an interview to be published Sunday. “Whoever believes that a symbolic tank parade on the alliance's eastern border will bring security is mistaken,” Steinmeier said ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw beginning July 8. “We are well-advised to not create pretexts to renew an old confrontation,” he emphasized. 'Deadly irony: US calls Russia ‘aggressive’ as NATO creeps eastward' (Op-Edge by Robert Bridge) https://t.co/1k8aZ9k7uI Rather than inflaming the situation further “through saber-rattling and warmongering,” there ought to be more space for dialogue and cooperation with Moscow, Steinmeier said. It would be “fatal to now narrow the focus to the military, and seek a remedy solely through a policy of deterrence,” German FM said, calling to give way to diplomacy instead of military posturing. Calling for dialogue and a diplomatic approach, Steinmeier also mentioned the necessity of maintaining military preparedness of NATO. The alliance should also consider the possibility to “renew discussions about the benefits of disarmament and arms control for security in Europe,” he said. The Anaconda drills have become NATO’s largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War, bringing to Poland over 31,000 troops from 24 NATO member states and “partner nations,” including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and others. Moscow has once again pointed out that augmentation of NATO military presence in Eastern Europe and Baltics is unjustified, stressing that Russia has no plans whatsoever to interfere with any country in the region. “I am convinced that every serious and honest politician is well aware that Russia will never invade any NATO member. We have no such plans,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated. The NATO summit in Warsaw is set to put “Russian threat” issue high on the agenda, as the gathering will be making the final decision on stationing additional NATO troops in Eastern Europe. More NATO troops deployed to Poland will be sending “a clear signal that an attack on Poland will be considered an attack on the whole Alliance,” the bloc’s Secretary General told reporters following his meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in early June. The statements made by NATO leadership put Russian diplomats in a position where they have to deny the obvious. “During the NATO secretary general’s recent visit to Poland, officials in this country [Poland] made statements suggesting that from now on Russia would know that any attack on Poland would mean an attack on NATO as a whole. This is completely absurd because they are discussing a non-existent problem. There are no plans for any attacks on Poland,” Russian envoy to NATO Aleksandr Grushko said in an interview with TV channel Russia-24. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said that NATO has “an absolutely slapdash attitude to our position on anything,” adding that it was the US that had unilaterally quit the missile defense treaty, which was initially signed to “provide strategic balance in the world.” NATO “needs a foreign enemy, otherwise what would be the reason for the existence of such an organization,” said the Russian leader. The conflict in Ukraine, caused by a bloody coup supported by the US and its European NATO allies, was forced on that country “to substantiate the very existence of the North Atlantic alliance,” the Russian president concluded. Putin assured his audience that he does not want to proceed to a new Cold War, as “no one wants it.”“However dramatic the logic of the development of international relations might seem on the outside, it’s not the logic of global confrontation,” he explained. \",\n",

However, I’ve no doubt the NHS will pull out all the stops as it has done in the other two strikes, to minimize the disruption. “We are expecting around 5,000 procedures to be affected and need to be rescheduled as a result of the action over the next couple of days,” she added. An Ipsos Mori poll showed that 65 percent of the public support the strikes.

Got to love Dennis Skinner for his commitment pic.twitter.com/ucX7VellIX “As the government forces us into another round of industrial action, it seriously needs to think whether the pride that has got themselves into this appalling mess is really the legacy they want to leave, or whether trying to find a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of the government, the NHS, patients and all the people of this country,” he wrote. The two-day strike is the third since the New Year and was organized after talks between the government and junior doctors broke down, with Hunt deciding to impose the new contract without agreement. Previous strikes have focused on adjustments to pay and overtime working hours, which junior doctors said would leave them working longer hours for less pay, despite the government insisting that the new contract would result in a net pay rise of 13.5 percent. Visited the #juniordoctors on picket line this morning outside Hillingdon Hospital to show 100% support from me pic.twitter.com/GbxSbDWKtd A deal was almost reached during last-minute talks, but eventually they collapsed after both parties refused to compromise on Saturday pay. Currently junior doctors net a premium rate for working on a Saturday, but new government plans would see Saturday treated as a regular working day, meaning doctors could lose out. Many Labour MPs joined picket lines on Wednesday morning, including Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and veteran MP Dennis Skinner. The Green Party has openly backed the strike, and its health spokesperson Larry Sanders called Hunt a “hypocrite.” “The hypocrisy of Jeremy Hunt announcing that he was imposing a contract on junior doctors exactly one year after he ‘called time on NHS bullying’ is astounding. Those junior doctors are essential to a functioning NHS and they will go on to become leaders of the service. They need to be treated with the respect that they deserve.” \",\n",

However, by highlighting the sexual orientation of the Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, the newspaper found itself in hot water, with many accusing it of “outright homophobia.” If the worst they can say about you is you're an OPENLY GAY EX-OLYMPIC FENCER TOP JUDGE, you've basically won life. pic.twitter.com/j8tUTjODuP Guardian Columnist Owen Jones, who has often spoken about the prejudice he has been subjected to as a gay man, took to Twitter saying: “I’d like to take back control from this bigoted crap.” Another user, whose Twitter name is Neil Marshall, said: “High Court announcement has revealed a new homophobic and racist low from today’s Daily Mail.

The losses incurred by the USSR during World War Two were enormous and they will never be forgotten by the UK, she said.

Dervish was the first of 78 convoys that delivered 4 million tons of supplies, including 7,000 aircraft and 5,000 tanks, to the USSR between August 1941 and May 1945. Thousands of sailors braved freezing temperatures and the constant threat of attacks to deliver provisions, ammunition and fighter planes. Three thousand sailors were lost in the operations. More than 3000 British troops and their comrades perished during #ArcticConvoys. We honour them all #Dervish75pic.twitter.com/ZDDq5nTiwl The events in Arkhangelsk were also attended by more than 40 Allied World War Two veterans, many of whom maintain friendly relations with the former Soviet Army veterans living in Russia. Some of them also told RT they do not share the anti-Russian sentiments expressed by some Western elites. “If we keep friendship at this level… then hopefully we can influence the politicians,” one of the veterans told RT.

The Arctic convoys provided 23 percent of lend-lease supplies to the Soviet Union during World War Two, worth $13.5 billion. ',\n",
