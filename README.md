# Text as Data: Computational Text Analysis
This is a course offered in Trinity Term 2021 at Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Oxford


We will be using Python as a programming language during this course.
The course will start by introducing text processing mechanisms. We are going to learn about mechanisms like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and named-entity recognition.
The course will also provide insight in methods of managing and manipulating text data in Python.
We will then cover aspects of numerical representation of text, for example like word-embedding, and also discuss metrics of text similarity.
After that, we will focus on methods of unsupervised machine learning like clustering and topic modelling, as well as, supervised machine learning methods, with a focus on classification techniques and sentiment analysis.

The syllabus with all class details is posted on Canvas.
